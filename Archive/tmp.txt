the worldwide economy continues to be impacted by the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic and emergence and spread of new variants of the virus demand for oil and gas products has increased with the lifting of certain restrictions including certain travel restrictions and stayathome orders current crude oil ngl and natural gas demand and prices could be negatively impacted by a resurgence of

of illness quarantines government actions vaccine mandates or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic as a result of higher vaccination rates and lower infection rates in 2021 we lifted certain workplace restrictions implemented in the initial stages of the pandemic and implemented new workplace safety protocols and procedures in our offices and work sites to help mitigate the spread

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic may also materially adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations to the extent the covid19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business operations financial condition and operating results it may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described herein governmental actions and political instability may affect occidentals results of operations occidentals businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal state local and international governments and political interests as a result occidental faces risks of new or amended laws and regulations or new or different applications or interpretations of existing laws and regulations including those related to drilling manufacturing or production processes including flaring and well stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and acidization pipelines labor and employment taxes royalty rates

law reinstates the federal superfund excise taxes on various chemicals that oxychem manufactures these excise taxes could lead to higher costs and impact margins in november 2021 the house of representatives passed the build back better act bbb which contains several climaterelated provisions while the bbb was not enacted in 2021 renewed efforts are expected in 2022 to legislate bbb or portions thereof provisions if any that reduce demand for oil and gas could negatively affect occidentals revenue in november 2021 the us department of the interior doi released its report on the federal oil and gas leasing program recommending increasing royalty rates and rents for drilling programs on federal public lands and in federal offshore waters in addition to prioritizing leasing in areas with known resource potential and in proximity to existing oil and gas infrastructure and avoiding leasing in areas with competing uses such as recreation wildlife habitat conservation and historical and cultural resources if enacted the regulations could increase royalties payable to the federal government and limit future potential drilling sites in january 2022 the us district court for the district of columbia issued a decision to invalidate the results of bureau of ocean energy managements oil and gas lease sale in the gulf of mexico of which occidental was the high bidder on 30 additional new blocks located nearby to its existing host platforms ruling that the environmental analysis of ghg emissions was inadequate under the national environmental policy act nepa the doi which oversees federal oil and gas development is currently reviewing the decision the decision does not affect occidentals existing leases or operations but restrictions or uncertainty regarding federal lease sales and associated nepa requirements could impact the ability to develop resources in areas outside of existing leases in january 2021 the colorado oil and gas conservation commission cogcc adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or setbacks on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures pursuant to the regulations well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner as part of the permitting process the cogcc will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2000 feet of an occupied structure alternatively the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance occidental has a dedicated multidisciplinary stakeholder relations team that conducts regulatory and community outreach with respect to its permit applications and operations in colorado while occidental has not been denied any permits and received its first approved oil and gas development plan permit under the new state regulations in the fourth quarter of 2021 any significant delays could result in changes to our development program in the dj basin and our ability to establish new proved undeveloped pud locations by meeting the secs reasonably certain threshold for adding pud reserves texas and new mexico have experienced an increase in seismic activity with events measuring magnitude 3 or greater in each state in the fourth quarter of 2021 both states issued new guidelines for operators to prevent or mitigate seismic activity focused on produced water disposal wells these guidelines also require operators to implement response plans for activities within agencydesignated seismic response areas these states have curtailed water disposal and suspended permits in seismic response areas particularly in deep disposal wells occidental does not operate deep disposal wells in the seismic response areas established by the state agencies to date and its shallow disposal wells have been authorized to operate at agencyapproved volume limits occidental also has central water treatment and recycling facilities that reduce the need for disposal of produced water while occidentals ability to drill and complete wells or to dispose of surplus produced water has not been impacted by these seismic guidelines to date increased seismicity or regulatory responses to seismic events could impact the location timing and cost of occidentals development program and existing operations in seismic response areas in addition occidental has experienced and may continue to experience adverse consequences such as risk of loss or production limitations because certain of its international operations are located in countries affected by political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions exposure to such risks may increase if a greater percentage of occidentals future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources climate change and further regulation of ghg and other air emissions may adversely affect occidentals operations or results continuing political social and industry attention to climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional and local legislation and regulatory programs to reduce ghg emissions in december 2009 the environmental protection agency epa determined that co2 methane and other ghg emissions endanger public health and the environment because they contribute to warming of the earths atmosphere and other climatic changes based on these findings the epa began adopting and implementing regulations to restrict ghg emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act the epa issued regulations in 2012 and 2016 to address methane and volatile organic compound voc emissions from certain new or modified oil and gas sources the methane provisions of which were rescinded by the trump administrations 2020 methane policy rule the biden administration has identified climate change as a priority and has identified a variety of avenues to prohibit or restrict oil and gas development activities in certain areas in june 2021 congress and president biden rescinded the 2020 policy rule under the congressional review act reinstating the methane provisions of epas 2012 and 2016 regulations an action that occidental supported in november 2021 the white house office of domestic climate policy issued a us methane emissions reduction action plan that solicited public comment on the epas proposed framework for expanding federal regulations the proposal would regulate 10 oxy 2021 form 10k risk factors methane and voc emissions from a broader set of new upstream and midstream operations as well as various existing operations the epa is expected to issue proposed regulations in 2022 based on this framework several state governments have also established rules aimed at reducing ghg emissions some including ghg cap and trade programs and others directly regulating equipment that emits ghg including methane and other compounds most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels including refineries and natural gas processing plants to acquire and surrender emission allowances other us states where occidental operates including colorado new mexico and texas adopted or proposed new regulations policies or strategies in 2021 that increase inspection recordkeeping reporting enforcement and controls on flaring venting and equipment that emit methane and other compounds at oil and gas facilities in certain instances these states anticipate tying the processing and active status of oil and gas permits including drilling permits to air emissions and compliance for example colorado has established ghg intensity targets for dj basin operators in 2025 2027 and 2030 which occidental currently meets these and other government actions relating to ghg and other air emissions could require occidental to incur increased operating and maintenance costs including higher rates charged by service providers costs to purchase operate and maintain emissions control systems to acquire emission allowances pay carbon taxes or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements or prevent occidental from conducting oil and gas development activities in certain areas or they could promote the use of alternative sources of energy and thereby decrease demand for oil ngl and natural gas and other products that occidentals businesses produce any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming and thereby reduce demand for oil ngl natural gas or other products produced by occidentals businesses and lower the value of its reserves consequently government actions designed to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on occidentals business financial condition results of operations cash flows and reserves it is difficult to predict the timing certainty and scope of such government actions and their ultimate effect on occidental which could depend on among other things the type and extent of ghg emissions reductions required the availability and price of emission allowances or credits the availability and price of alternative fuel sources the energy sectors covered and occidentals ability to recover the costs incurred through its operating agreements or the pricing of its oil ngl natural gas and other products and whether service providers are able to pass increased costs through to occidental there also have been efforts in the investment community including investment advisers and certain sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds as well as political actors and other stakeholders promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities reducing access to capital markets and pressuring lenders to limit funding or increase the cost of lending to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves additionally institutional lenders who provide financing to oil and gas companies have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may substantially reduce or elect not to provide funding for oil and gas companies such environmental initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could adversely affect our business activities operations and ability to access capital and could cause the market value of our securities to decrease our cost of capital to increase and adversely affect our reputation finally increasing attention to climate change risks has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and additional private litigation against occidental without regard to causation or our contribution to the asserted damage which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business occidentals businesses may experience catastrophic events the occurrence of severe weather events such as hurricanes floods freezes and heat waves droughts earthquakes or other acts of nature pandemics well blowouts fires explosions pipeline ruptures chemical releases oil releases including maritime releases releases into navigable waters and groundwater contamination material or mechanical failure power outages industrial accidents physical or cyber attacks abnormally pressured or structured formations and other events that cause operations to cease or be curtailed may negatively affect occidentals businesses and the communities in which it operates coastal operations are particularly susceptible to disruption from severe weather events any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of damage to and destruction of property and equipment including property and equipment owned by thirdparties which our operations rely upon damage to natural resources pollution and other environmental damage including spillage or mishandling of recovered chemicals or fluids regulatory investigations fines and penalties loss of well location acreage expected production and related reserves suspension or delay of our operations substantial liability claims and significant repair and remediation costs that increase our breakeven economics thirdparty insurance may not provide adequate coverage or occidental may be selfinsured with respect to the related losses in addition under certain circumstances we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own lease or operate as a result we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities for environmental matters for which we do not have insurance coverage which could reduce or oxy 2021 form 10k

volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affect occidentals results of operations occidentals financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products particularly oil and to a lesser extent ngl natural gas and its chemical products prices for oil ngl and natural gas fluctuate widely historically the markets for oil ngl and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future if the prices of oil ngl or natural gas continue to be volatile or decline occidentals operations financial condition cash flows level of expenditures and the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties may be materially and adversely affected prices are set by global and local market forces which are not in occidentals

financial condition results of operations liquidity ability to reduce debt access to and cost of capital and ability to finance planned capital expenditures pay dividends and repurchase shares reduce the amount of oil ngl and natural gas that occidental can produce economically cause occidental to delay or postpone some of its capital projects reduce occidentals revenues operating income or cash flows reduce the amounts of occidentals estimated proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves reduce the carrying value of occidentals oil and natural gas properties due to recognizing impairments of proved properties unproved properties and exploration assets reduce the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil ngl and natural gas reserves and adversely affect the ability of occidentals partners to fund their working interest capital requirements generally occidentals historical practice has been to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities in 2019 occidental entered into 2020 brentpriced 3way collars combined with 2021 call options on the same volume to manage its nearterm exposure to cash flow variability from oil price risks in 2020 the 2021 call options were sold to enhance the upside retention in 2020 in 2020 management elected to hedge a portion of occidentals expected 2021 natural gas production to enhance cash flow stability as of december 31 2021 there are no active commodity hedges in place 12 oxy 2021 form 10k risk factors management may choose to put hedges in place in the future for oil ngl and natural gas commodities commodity price risk management activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from price increases and may expose us to regulatory counterparty credit and other risks the prices obtained for occidentals chemical products correlate to the strength of the united states and global economies as well as chemical industry expansion and contraction cycles occidental also depends on feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations occidental may experience delays cost overruns losses or other unrealized expectations in development efforts and exploration activities oil ngl and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil ngl and natural gas production in its development and exploration activities occidental bears the risks of equipment failures construction delays escalating costs or competition for services materials supplies or labor property or border disputes disappointing drilling results or reservoir performance title problems and other associated risks that may affect its ability to profitably grow production replace reserves and achieve its targeted returns actions by thirdparty operators of our properties permit delays and costs of drilling wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances and oil ngl and natural gas gathering transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations exploration is inherently risky and is subject to delays misinterpretation of geologic or engineering data unexpected geologic conditions or finding reserves of disappointing quality or quantity which may result in significant losses occidentals oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments which affect among other things its ability to source production and replace reserves results of operations reserves replacement and the level of oil and gas production depend in part on occidentals ability to profitably acquire additional reserves occidental has many competitors including national oil companies some of which i are larger and better funded ii may be willing to accept greater risks iii have greater access to capital iv have substantially larger staffs or v have special competencies competition for access to reserves may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delay of reserve replacement efforts further during periods of low product prices any cash conservation efforts may delay production growth and reserve replacement efforts also there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry our failure to acquire properties potentially grow production replace reserves and attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations in addition occidentals acquisition activities carry risks that it may i not fully realize anticipated benefits due to lessthanexpected reserves or production or changed circumstances such as declines in oil ngl and natural gas prices ii bear unexpected integration costs or experience other integration difficulties iii experience share price declines based on the markets evaluation of the activity or iv be subject to liabilities that are greater than anticipated occidentals oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision reported oil and gas reserves are an estimate based on periodic review of reservoir characteristics and recoverability including production decline rates operating performance and economic feasibility at the prescribed weighted average commodity prices future operating costs and capital expenditures workover and remedial costs assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies the quantity quality and interpretation of relevant data taxes and availability of funds the procedures and methods for estimating the reserves by our internal engineers were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants however there are inherent uncertainties in estimating reserves actual production revenues expenditures oil ngl and natural gas prices and taxes with respect to our reserves may vary from estimates and the variance may be material additional regulation around ghg emissions and future costs related to a lower carbon intensive economy could result in a shortened oil and gas reservoir reserve life as the underlying reserves become uneconomical if occidental were required to make significant negative reserve revisions its results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected in addition the discounted cash flows included in this form 10k should not be construed as the fair value of the reserves attributable to our properties the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year in accordance with sec regulations actual future prices and costs may differ materially from sec regulationcompliant prices and costs used for oxy 2021 form 10k 13 risk factors purposes of estimating future discounted net cash flows from proved reserves also actual future net cash flows may differ from these discounted net cash flows due to the amount and timing of actual production availability of financing for capital expenditures necessary to develop our undeveloped reserves supply and demand for oil ngl and natural gas increases or decreases in consumption of oil ngl and natural gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation occidentals future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to execute new business strategies effectively occidentals results of operations depend on the extent to which it can execute new business strategies effectively relative to both the larger transition to sustainable energy and government regulation regarding the environment and climate change occidentals strategies which include the goal of reaching netzero emissions in its operations and energy use before 2040 are subject to business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies many of which are beyond its control additionally occidental may be forced to develop or implement new technologies at substantial costs to achieve its strategies effective execution of these goals may require substantial new capital which might not be available to occidental in the amounts or at the times expected in addition raising such capital may increase our leverage or overall costs of doing business these uncertainties and costs could cause occidental to not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results and benefits of its business strategies certain of occidentals emissions goals are dependent upon the successful implementation of new and existing technology on an industrial scale these technologies are in various stages of development or implementation and may require more capital or take longer to develop than currently expected further these carbon management technologies are in competition with technology being developed by other companies the carbon management solutions are not well established and while occidental believes it has access to the technology and the expertise necessary to develop these on an industrial scale occidental may not ultimately succeed in achieving its ghg emissions reduction and netzero goals occidentals strategy to include carbon management in its product line is also dependent upon demand for carbon sequestration and related carbon offsets and attributes if this market does not develop or if the regulatory environment does not support carbon management activities occidental may not be successful in entering this industry occidentals aspirations goals and initiatives related to carbon management and overall sustainability expose it to numerous risks we continue to develop new technology and strategies to meet our emissions goals our efforts to research establish accomplish and accurately report on our emissions goals targets and strategies expose occidental to numerous operational reputational financial legal and other risks our ability to reach our target emissions is subject to a multitude of factors and conditions many of which are out of our control examples of such factors include evolving government regulation the pace of changes in technology the successful development and deployment of existing or new technologies and business solutions on a commercial scale the availability timing and cost of equipment manufactured goods and services and the availability of requisite financing and federal and state incentive programs occidental may face increased scrutiny from the investment community other stakeholders and the media related to its emissions goals and strategies if occidentals emissions goals and strategies to achieve them do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations or standards occidentals reputation ability to attract and retain employees and attractiveness as an investment business partner or acquirer could be negatively impacted similarly occidentals failure or perceived failure to fulfill its emissions goals and targets to comply with ethical environmental social governance or other standards regulations or expectations or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters effectively could have the same negative impacts and further expose occidental to government enforcement actions and private litigation even if occidental achieves its goals targets and objectives it may not realize all of the benefits that it expected at the time the goals were established occidental has previously recorded impairments of its proved and unproved oil and gas properties and will continue to assess further impairments in the future we have recorded impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties resulting from prolonged declines in oil and gas prices and may record such impairments in the future past impairments included pretax impairment and related charges to both proved and unproved oil and gas properties and a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for crude inventory if there is an adverse downturn of the macroeconomic conditions and if such downturn is expected to or does persist for a prolonged period of time occidentals oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment which could result in additional noncash asset impairments such impairments could be material to the financial statements future costs associated with reducing emissions and carbon impacts as well as impacts resulting from other risk factors described herein could lead to impairments in the future if such costs significantly increase our breakeven economics 14 oxy 2021 form 10k risk factors occidental uses co2 for its eor operations occidentals production from these operations may decline if occidental is not able to obtain sufficient amounts of co2 occidentals co2 eor operations are critical to occidentals longterm strategy oil production from occidentals co2 eor projects depends largely on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring or anthropogenic humanmade co2 occidentals ability to produce oil from its co2 eor projects would be hindered if the supply of co2 was limited due to among other things problems with current co2 producing wells and facilities including compression equipment catastrophic pipeline failure or the ability to economically purchase naturally occurring or anthropogenic co2 this could have a material adverse effect on occidentals financial condition results of operations or cash flows future oil production from its co2 eor operations is dependent on the timing volumes and location of co2 injections and in particular occidentals ability to obtain sufficient volumes of co2 market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of the development of naturally occurring co2 sources or construction of plants that produce anthropogenic co2 as a byproduct that can be purchased thus limiting the amount of co2 available for use in occidentals co2 eor operations occidental is exposed to cyberrelated risks the oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct certain exploration development and production activities occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems related infrastructure technologies and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas chemicals marketing and pipeline operations use of the internet cloud services mobile communication systems and other public networks exposes occidentals business and that of other third parties with whom occidental does business to cyber attacks cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years information and industrial control technology system failures network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results leading to the unintentional disclosure of company partner customer

negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways including but not limited to the following unauthorized access to seismic data reserves information strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources data corruption communication or systems interruption or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in delays and failure to reach the intended target or cause a drilling incident data corruption communication or systems interruption or operational disruptions of productionrelated infrastructure could result in a loss of production or accidental discharge a cyber attack on our chemical operations could result in a disruption of the manufacturing and marketing of our products or a potential environmental hazard a cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our construction and development projects a cyber attack on thirdparty gathering pipeline processing terminal or other infrastructure systems could delay or prevent us from producing transporting processing and marketing our production a cyber attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities a cyber attack that halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feedstock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market a cyber attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption a cyber attack on our automated and surveillance systems could cause a loss in production and potential environmental hazards a deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of noncompliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties and a cyber attack resulting in the loss or disclosure of or damage to our or any of our customers or suppliers data or confidential information could harm our business by damaging our reputation subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability and requiring us to incur significant costs including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps although occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber attack that it believes are reasonable there can be no assurance that such cyber security measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches of its systems from occurring and if a breach occurs it may remain undetected for an extended period of time further occidental has no control over the comparable systems of the third parties with whom it does business while occidental has experienced cyber attacks in the past occidental has not suffered any material losses however if in the future occidentals cyber security measures are compromised or prove insufficient the potential consequences to occidentals businesses and the communities in which it operates could be significant as cyber attacks continue to evolve oxy 2021 form

the same rate and a failure to replace reserves may negatively affect occidentals business producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors unless occidental conducts successful exploration or development activities acquires properties containing proved reserves or both proved reserves will generally decline and negatively impact our business the value of our securities and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace reserves that are depleted by production or replace our declining production with new production by successfully allocating annual capital to maintain our reserves and production base occidental expects infill development projects extensions discoveries and improved recovery to continue as main sources for reserve additions but factors such as geology government regulations and permits the effectiveness of development plans and the ability to make the necessary capital investments or acquire capital are partially or fully outside managements control and could cause results to differ materially from expectations occidentals operations and financial results could be significantly negatively impacted by its offshore operations occidental is vulnerable to risks associated with our offshore operations that could negatively impact our operations and financial results occidental conducts offshore operations primarily in the gulf of mexico and its operations and financial results are vulnerable to certain unique risks associated with operating offshore including conditions relating to the following hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions geological complexities and water depths associated with such operations limited number of partners available to participate in projects oilfield service costs and availability compliance with environmental safety and other laws and regulations terrorist attacks or piracy remediation and other costs and regulatory changes resulting from oil spills emissions or releases of hazardous materials failure of equipment or facilities and response capabilities for personnel equipment or environmental incidents in addition occidental conducts some of its exploration in deep waters greater than 1000 feet where operations support services and decommissioning activities are more difficult and costly than in shallower waters the deep waters in the gulf of mexico as well as international deepwater locations lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters as a result deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and the time that occidental can market its production thereby increasing the risk involved with these operations occidentals operations in the gulf of mexico were negatively impacted by hurricane ida in 2021 which reduced production by approximately 25 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe associated with safely shutting in production evacuating and then restarting the platforms occidentals indebtedness may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns

wti crude increased to 6791 from 3940 and the average annual brent price per barrel increased to 7078 from 4321 while the worldwide economy continues to be impacted by the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic and emergence and spread of new variants of the virus demand for oil has returned to near prepandemic levels current uncertainty of whether oil supply will be able to sustain a continued supply response as well as geopolitical risks have resulted in a significant increase to benchmark oil prices in addition current oil prices could be negatively impacted by the emergence of new covid19 variants slow vaccine distribution in developing economies or the recurrence or tightening of travel restrictions and stayathome orders strategy occidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its integrated portfolio of oil and gas chemicals and midstream and marketing assets and its commitment to implement carbon management and storage solutions

during 2021 coupled with divestiture proceeds to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing its debt and other financial obligations in 2021 occidental reduced total borrowings at face value of over 67 billion and retired interest rate swaps with a notional value of 750 million the 2021 balance sheet improvement efforts have significantly reduced debt maturities in the near and medium

sustainability commitments and established additional interim targets toward its netzero goals to advance a lowcarbon future occidental seeks to meet its sustainability and environmental goals through its development and commercialization of technologies that lower both ghg emissions from industrial processes and existing atmospheric concentrations of co2 occidental believes that carbon removal technologies including dac and ccus can with incentives necessary for their development and deployment provide essential co2 reductions in the medium term while the world transitions to a lower carbon intensive economy occidental has undertaken the following actions among others toward advancing its lowcarbon strategy incorporated specific ghg emissions reduction targets in its rcf and receivables securitization facility which can impact its costs related to its borrowing facilities invested in a third party to develop a zeroemission natural gas generation demonstration facility and license the underlying technology initiated a front end engineering and design study on an industrial scale dac facility implemented multiple programs to reduce emissions and the routine flaring of gas delivered

oil and gas exploration and production industry is highly competitive is subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions and operations are highly dependent on oil prices and to a lesser extent ngl and natural gas prices oil prices increased significantly in 2021 during 2021 as compared to 2020 the average annual bbl of wti crude increased to 6791 from 3940 and the average annual brent price per barrel increased to 7078 from 4321 oil prices will continue to be affected by i global supply and demand which are generally a function of global economic conditions inventory levels production or supply chain disruptions technological advances regional market conditions and the actions of opec other significant producers and governments ii transportation capacity infrastructure constraints and costs in producing areas iii currency exchange rates and inflation rates and iv the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions ngl prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock in addition infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals as well as government regulations global lng demand and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas we expect that oil prices in the nearterm will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil and gas supply and demand these and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil ngl and domestic gas prices reliably for purposes of the current capital plan occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to its highestreturn assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices international gas prices are generally fixed under longterm contracts occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital the timing process and ultimate cost to transition to a lower carbon intensive economy remains largely unknown various industry forecasts indicate a growing demand for hydrocarbons for the remainder of the current decade occidental believes its operational flexibility regarding its mix of shortcycle and midcycle projects and its knowledge and experience in co2 separation transportation use recycling and storage means that its oil and gas segment is well positioned to support occidentals transition to net zero as well as create opportunities in a lowcarbon future oxy 2021 form 10k 33 managements discussion and analysis chemical segment business

ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated during this midyear review using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month for the twelve months ended june 30 2021 unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation several factors could change occidentals proved oil and gas reserves for example occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit occidentals share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline generally occidentals net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices in other cases particularly with longlived properties lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical for such properties higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidentals control such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs these factors in turn could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded changes in the political and regulatory climate could lead to decreases in proved reserves as development horizons may be extended into the future occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in managements plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the oxy 2021 form 10k 51 managements discussion and analysis period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows unless observable and comparable transactions are available the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future production product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in impairments for impairment testing unless prices are contractually fixed occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves market prices for oil ngl and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future changes in global supply and demand transportation capacity currency exchange rates applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 148 billion as of december 31 2021 and 186 billion as of december 31 2020 the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment significant unproved properties primarily as a result of the acquisition are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments numerous factors are considered including but not limited to availability of funds for future exploration and development activities current exploration and development plans favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property geologists evaluation of the property the current and projected political and regulatory climate contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties if an impairment is indicated occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach in situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves if undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties proved reserves occidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the sec and financial accounting standards board this definition includes oil ngl and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods government regulations etc at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions for reserves information see the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities under item 8 of this form 10k engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information occidentals estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons these estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised either upward or downward as warranted by additional data revisions are necessary due to changes in among other things development plans reservoir performance prices economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling decreases in prices for example may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date a material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dda and could result in property impairments the most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in occidentals oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the dda rate for example a 5 increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the dda rate by approximately 065bbl which would increase or decrease pretax income by approximately 275 million annually at current production rates 52 oxy 2021 form 10k managements discussion and analysis fair values occidental estimates fairvalue of longlived assets for impairment testing assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in nonmonetary transactions pension plan assets and initial measurements of aros accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs when estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed occidental must apply various assumptions financial assets and liabilities occidental utilizes published prices or counterparty statements for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods occidental values exchangecleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date these derivatives are classified as using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 1 overthecounter otc bilateral financial commodity contracts international exchange contracts options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves the assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as using unobservable inputs level 3 within the valuation hierarchy occidental values debt using marketobservable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets for debt instruments that are not traded the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk nonfinancial assets occidental uses marketobservable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued when occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a marketobservable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support managements assumptions the cost approach is based on managements best estimate of the current asset replacement cost the income approach is based on managements best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate riskadjusted discount rate such evaluations involve significant judgment the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput development and operating costs and the timing thereof economic and regulatory climates and other factors most of which are often outside of managements control however assumptions used reflect a market participants view of longterm prices costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in occidentals business plans and investment decisions environmental liabilities and expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate occidental records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is oxy 2021 form 10k 53 managements discussion and analysis highly probable many factors could affect occidentals future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidentals proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at cercla npl sites occidentals environmental remediation liabilities include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its environmental remediation liabilities accordingly if occidental were to adjust the balance of its environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings for example if the balance were reduced by 10 occidental would record a pretax gain of 110 million if the balance were increased by 10 occidental would record an additional remediation expense of 110 million income taxes occidental files various us federal state and foreign income tax returns the impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted in general deferred federal state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets if occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense benefit see note 10  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k loss contingencies occidental is involved in the normal course of business in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings and audits occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated in addition occidental discloses in aggregate its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management

securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement whether due to error or fraud our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks such procedures included examining on a test basis evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that 1 relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and 2 involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate evaluation of the environmental liability associated with the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river site as discussed in notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements the company accrues a liability for estimated environmental remedial activities when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be estimated the company accrued a liability related to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the remedial activities required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river site as of december 31 2021 the companys total estimated environmental liabilities were 11 billion which includes the estimated environmental liability for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river site we identified the evaluation of the environmental liability associated with the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river site as a critical audit matter there was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in applying and evaluating the results of our procedures this is due to 1 possible changes to expected remedial activities to implement the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the record of decision rod issued by the environmental protection agency epa and their estimated costs and 2 possible changes to the companys estimated share of the remediation costs oxy 2021 form 10k 59 financial statements report the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the companys environmental liability process to estimate the cost of remedial activities and estimate the companys allocable share of the remediation costs we evaluated the remedial activities and related cost assumptions used by the company by comparing them against remedial activities and cost estimates provided by the epa in the rod we compared certain design documentation provided by the company to the epa in order to identify potential differences between the design plan and the rod and assessed the impact of any such differences on the remediation cost assumptions used by the company to estimate the liability we assessed the companys assumption for its allocable share of the remediation costs and analyzed publicly available data sources for information that might be contrary to the information used by the company we involved an environmental analysis professional with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in reading correspondence between the company and the epa related to the design phase for this site to assess the companys remediation cost assumptions assessment of the estimated proved oil and gas reserves on the determination of depreciation and depletion expense related to proved oil and gas properties as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the company determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method under this method capitalized costs are amortized over estimated proved reserves for the year ended december 31 2021 the company recorded depreciation and depletion expense related to proved oil and gas properties of 77 billion we identified the assessment of the estimated proved oil and gas reserves on the determination of depreciation and depletion expense related to proved oil and gas properties as a critical audit matter complex auditor judgment was required to assess the companys estimate of proved oil and gas reserves which is a key input for the determination of depreciation and depletion expense estimating proved oil and gas reserves requires the expertise of professional petroleum reservoir engineers the key assumptions included 1 commodity prices inclusive of market differentials 2 estimated future production quantities and 3 estimated operating and capital costs the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the companys depreciation and depletion process including the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves we analyzed and assessed the determination of depreciation and depletion expense for compliance with industry and regulatory standards we assessed compliance of the methodology used by the companys engineering and technical staff to estimate proved oil and gas reserves with industry and regulatory standards we read the findings of the independent reservoir engineering specialists review of the methods and procedures used by the company in estimating the proved reserves for compliance with industry and regulatory standards we assessed the commodity prices including relevant market differentials used by the companys engineering and technical staff by comparing them to publicly available prices adjusted for historical market differentials to assess the companys ability to accurately estimate future production quantities we compared the future production quantity assumptions used by the company in prior periods to the actual production amounts we compared the estimated future production

petroleum corporation and subsidiaries note 1  summary of significant accounting policies nature of operations occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates occidentals principal businesses consist of three reporting segments oil and gas chemical and midstream and marketing the oil and gas segment explores for develops and produces oil which includes condensate ngl and natural gas oxychem primarily manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls the midstream and marketing segment purchases markets gathers processes transports and stores oil which includes condensate ngl natural gas co2 and power it also optimizes its transportation and storage capacity and invests in entities that conduct similar activities such as wes the midstream and marketing segment also includes olcv olcv seeks to leverage occidentals legacy of carbon management expertise to develop ccus projects including the commercialization of dac technology and invests in other lowcarbon technologies intended to reduce ghg emissions from our operations and strategically partner with other industries to help reduce their emissions principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap and include the accounts of occidental its subsidiaries its undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and previously variable interest entities for which occidental was the primary beneficiary occidental accounts for its share of oil and gas exploration and production ventures in which it has a direct working interest by reporting its proportionate share of assets liabilities revenues costs and cash flows within the relevant lines on the balance sheets statements of operations and statements of cash flows certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation wes investment wes is a publicly traded limited partnership with its common units traded on the nyse under the ticker symbol wes wes owns the entire noneconomic general partner interest and a 98 limited partner interest in wes operating as a result of certain partnership agreement amendments and other related agreements executed in 2019 occidental does not consolidate wes under the voting interest model since occidental does not control the power to appoint or remove a successor general partner as of december 31 2021 occidentals equity method investment in wes was approximately 20 billion which exceeds occidentals prorata interest in the net assets of wes by 362 million this basis difference is primarily associated with wes ppe and equity investments and is subject to amortization over their estimated average lives as of december 31 2021 occidental owned all of a 22 nonvoting general partner interest and 497 of the limited partner units in wes on a combined basis with its 2 nonvoting limited partner interest in wes operating occidentals total effective economic interest in wes and its subsidiaries was 518 see note 4  investment and relatedparty transactions investments in unconsolidated entities occidentals percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates for which it exercises significant influence without having a controlling interest excluding oil and gas ventures in which occidental holds an undivided interest are accounted for under the equity method occidental reviews equitymethod investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an otherthantemporary decline in value may have occurred the amount of impairment if any is based on quoted market prices when available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows occidental evaluates the facts and circumstances of any distributions in excess of its carrying amount in the investment to determine the appropriate accounting including the source of the proceeds and any implicit or explicit commitments to fund the affiliate if there is no implicit or explicit commitment the distribution is treated as a gain if an implicit or explicit commitment exists to possibly fund the affiliate at a future date the distribution is recorded against the equitymethod investment see note 4  investments and relatedparty transactions for further discussion regarding investments in unconsolidated entities 68 oxy 2021 form 10k financial statements footnotes discontinued operations in connection with the acquisition occidental entered into a purchase and sale agreement with total to sell all of the assets liabilities businesses and operations of anadarkos operations in algeria ghana mozambique and south africa total and occidental completed the sale of the mozambique assets in september 2019 for approximately 42 billion and the south africa assets in january 2020 for approximately 100 million in april 2020 subsequent to communications with algerian government officials occidental determined that the sale of the algeria operations to total would not be consummated and the decision was made to continue to operate within algeria as a result as of the second quarter of 2020 occidental no longer classified the algeria operations as a held for sale asset in discontinued operations and reclassified prior periods to reflect the algeria operations as continuing operations in may 2020 occidental and total mutually agreed to execute a waiver of the obligation to purchase and sell the ghana assets and in october 2021 occidental closed on the sale of the ghana assets with a third party for a purchase price of 750 million unless otherwise indicated information presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements relates only to occidentals continuing operations information related to discontinued operations is included in note 5  acquisitions divestitures and other transactions and in some instances where appropriate is included as a separate disclosure within the individual notes to consolidated financial statements risks and uncertainties the process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires occidentals management to make informed estimates and judgments regarding certain types of financial statement balances and disclosures such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and judgments on expected outcomes as well as the materiality of transactions and balances changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information relating to such transactions and events may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from estimates upon settlement management believes that these estimates and judgments provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of occidentals financial statements occidental establishes a valuation allowance against net operating losses and other deferred tax assets to the extent it believes the future benefit from these assets will not be realized in the statutory carryforward periods realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon occidental generating sufficient future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences in jurisdictions where such assets originate the accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately 77 billion as of december 31 2021 and net sales of approximately 42 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 relating to occidentals operations in countries outside north america occidental operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that have experienced situations including such things as political instability nationalizations corruption armed conflict terrorism insurgency civil unrest security problems labor unrest opec production restrictions equipment import restrictions and sanctions all of which increase occidentals risk of loss delayed or restricted production or may result in other adverse consequences occidental attempts to conduct its affairs so as to mitigate its exposure to such risks and would seek compensation in the event of nationalization because occidentals major products are commodities significant changes in the prices of oil ngl natural gas and chemical products may have a significant impact on occidentals results of operations also see property plant and equipment section below receivables and other current assets trade receivables net of 42 billion and 21 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

cost and are reviewed periodically for obsolescence oil ngl and natural gas inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market for the chemical segment occidentals finished goods inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market for most of its domestic inventories other than materials and supplies the chemical segment uses the lastin firstout lifo method as it better matches current costs and current revenue for other countries occidental uses the firstin firstout method if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable or the averagecost method if the costs of goods are not specifically identifiable oxy 2021 form 10k 69 financial statements footnotes property plant and equipment oil and gas the carrying value of occidentals ppe represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset including any aros and capitalized interest net of accumulated dda and any impairment charges for assets acquired ppe cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date aros and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties under this method occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found if proved reserves have been found the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project at the end of each quarter management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular whether occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed the following table summarizes the activity of

injectants used in production and geological and geophysical costs as incurred occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unitofproduction method it amortizes leasehold costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves as a result of occidentals midyear reserve review undertaken in the second quarter of 2021 dda rates for the second half of 2021 were lower compared to the first half of 2021 due to increased proved reserves primarily related to positive price revisions proved oil ngl and natural gas reserves were estimated during this midyear review using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month for the twelve months ended june 30 2021 unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation proved reserves includes pud reserves pud reserves are supported by a management approved detailed fieldlevel development plan where sufficient capital has been committed to develop those reserves only pud reserves which are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan a portion of the pud reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved longterm development projects occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable if there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices significant changes in reserve estimates changes in managements plans or other significant events management will evaluate the property for impairment under the successful efforts method if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows unless observable and comparable transactions are available the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants the impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time these assumptions include estimates of future production 70 oxy 2021 form 10k financial statements footnotes product prices contractual prices estimates of riskadjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments see note 9  fair value measurements and below for further discussion of asset impairments net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were 148 billion as of december 31 2021 and 186 billion as of december 31 2020 the unproved amounts are not subject to dda until they are classified as proved properties individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment significant unproved properties primarily as a result of the acquisition are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments numerous factors are considered including but not limited to availability of funds for future exploration and development activities current exploration and development plans favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property geologists evaluation of the property the current and projected political and regulatory climate contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties if an impairment is indicated occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach in situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves if undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties chemical occidentals chemical assets are depreciated using either the unitofproduction or the straightline method based upon the estimated useful lives of the facilities the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical assets which range from three years to 50 years are also used for impairment tests the estimated useful lives for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained such expenditures consist of ongoing routine repairs and maintenance as well as planned major maintenance activities pmma ongoing routine repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred pmma costs are capitalized and amortized over the period until the next planned overhaul additionally occidental incurs capital expenditures that extend the remaining useful lives of existing assets increase their capacity or operating efficiency beyond the original specification or add value through modification for a different use these capital expenditures are not considered in the initial determination of the useful lives of these assets at the time they are placed into service the resulting revision if any of the assets estimated useful life is measured and accounted for prospectively without these continued expenditures the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidentals chemical assets include sustained higher or lower product prices which are affected by domestic and international competition demand feedstock costs energy prices environmental regulations and technological changes

related to domestic undeveloped leases that were set to expire in the nearterm where occidental had no plans to pursue exploration activities and 39 million related to occidentals mutually agreed early termination of its qatar idd el shargi south dome issd contract it is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments fair value measurements occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a threelevel fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to the valuation techniques level 1  using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities level 2  using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities and level 3  using unobservable inputs transfers between levels if any are reported at the end of each reporting period fair values  recurring occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs occidental utilizes the midpoint between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value in addition to using market data occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique for assets and liabilities carried at fair value occidental measures fair value using the following methods occidental values exchangecleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date these derivatives are classified as level 1 otc bilateral financial commodity contracts foreign exchange contracts interest rate swaps warrants options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industrystandard models that consider various inputs including quoted forward prices for commodities time value volatility factors credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments as well as other relevant economic measures substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves the assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as level 3 within the valuation hierarchy occidental values debt using marketobservable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets for debt instruments that are not traded the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk nonfinancial assets occidental uses marketobservable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued when occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a marketobservable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support managements assumptions the cost approach is based on managements best estimate of the current asset replacement cost the income approach is based on managements best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate riskadjusted discount rate such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput development and operating costs and the timing thereof economic and regulatory climates and other factors most of which are often outside of managements control however assumptions used reflect a market participants view of longterm prices costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in occidentals business plans and investment decisions 72 oxy 2021 form 10k financial statements footnotes accrued liabilities  current accrued liabilities

records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated in determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses occidental refers to currently available information including relevant past experience remedial objectives available technologies applicable laws and regulations and costsharing arrangements occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on managements estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred using the most costeffective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received or when receipt of recovery is highly probable many factors could affect occidentals future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses the most significant are 1 cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate 2 the length of time type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination 3 a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify occidentals proposed remedial plan 4 improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs 5 laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability and 6 changes in allocation or costsharing arrangements may occur certain sites involve multiple parties with various costsharing arrangements which fall into the following three categories 1 environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties 2 oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest or 3 contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of properties in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs in these circumstances occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate when estimating occidentals ultimate share of liability occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and based on these factors believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved in addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures which often take in excess of 10 years at cercla npl sites occidentals environmental remediation liabilities include managements estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems if remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in sitespecific data laws regulations technologies or engineering estimates occidental reviews and adjusts its environmental remediation liabilities accordingly asset retirement obligations occidental recognizes the fair value of aros in the period in which a determination is made that a legal obligation exists to dismantle an asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of its useful life and the cost of the obligation can be reasonably estimated the liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as time to abandonment future inflation rates and the riskadjusted discount rate when the liability is initially recorded occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related ppe balances if the estimated future cost of the aros changes occidental records an adjustment to both the aros and ppe over time the liability is increased expense is recognized for accretion and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset the majority of occidentals aros relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties at a certain number of its facilities occidental has identified conditional aros that are related mainly to plant decommissioning occidental does not know or cannot estimate when it may settle these obligations therefore occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities occidental will

derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such treatment otherwise any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current period for cash flow hedges the gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the item being hedged realized gains or losses from cash flow hedges and any ineffective portion are recorded as a component of net sales in the consolidated statements of operations ineffectiveness is primarily created by a lack of correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to location quality grade or changes in the expected quantity of the hedged item gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported net in the consolidated statements of operations there were no fair value hedges as of and during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 stockbased incentive plans occidental has

awards compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of occidentals common stock and the estimated payout on the grant date the fair value of stock options is estimated using a black scholes model for total shareholder return incentive tsri awards compensation value is initially measured on the grant date using the fair value derived from a monte carlo valuation model compensation expense for all awards is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods which is generally over the awards respective vesting or performance periods the stocksettled awards are expensed using the initially measured compensation value the liability resulting from cash settled awards and accrued dividends are remeasured at each reporting period dividends accrued on unvested awards are adjusted quarterly for any changes in the number of share equivalents expected to be paid based on the relevant performance and market criteria if applicable there are no outstanding awards under occidentals 2005 longterm incentive plan following the expiration of the nonqualified stock options granted in 2015 on february 11 2022 earnings per share occidentals instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stockbased awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and therefore have been deducted from earnings in computing basic and diluted earnings per share eps under the twoclass method basic eps was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock net of income allocated to participating securities by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during each period including vested but unissued shares and share units the computation of diluted eps reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock options warrants and unvested stock awards retirement and postretirement benefit plans occidental recognizes the overfunded or underfunded amounts of its defined

to approximately 40 of the yearend remediation balance over the next three to four years with the remainder over the subsequent 10 or more years occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for all of its environmental sites could be up to 13 billion maxus environmental sites when occidental acquired dscc in 1986 maxus agreed to indemnify occidental for a number of environmental sites including the diamond alkali superfund site site along a portion of the passaic river on june 17 2016 maxus and several affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal district court in the state of delaware prior to filing for bankruptcy maxus defended and indemnified occidental in connection with cleanup and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity including the site in march 2016 the epa issued a rod specifying remedial actions required for the lower 83 miles of the lower passaic river the rod does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river or newark bay during the third quarter of 2016 and following maxuss bankruptcy filing occidental and the epa entered into an aoc to complete the design of the proposed cleanup plan outlined in the rod with an estimated cost of 165 million the epa announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and remediation

potentially responsible parties occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the aoc and the rod and to perform remediation at other maxusindemnified sites in light of the maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties in june 2018 occidental filed a complaint under cercla in federal district court in the state of new jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the aoc and the rod or to perform other remediation activities at the site in september 2021 the epa issued a rod with an estimated cost of 441 million for an interim remedy plan for the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river at this time occidentals role or responsibilities under this rod and those of other potentially responsible parties have not been determined with the epa discussions between occidental and the epa are ongoing about this rod in june 2017 the court overseeing the maxus bankruptcy approved a plan to liquidate maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against current and former parents ypf and repsol as well as others to satisfy claims by occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs in july 2017 the courtapproved plan became final and the trust became effective the trust is pursuing claims against ypf repsol and others and is expected to distribute assets to maxus creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and plan in june 2018 the trust filed its complaint against ypf and repsol in delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon among other things fraudulent transfer and alter ego during 2019 the bankruptcy court denied repsols and ypfs motions to dismiss the complaint
