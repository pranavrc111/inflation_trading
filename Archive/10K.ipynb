the content of which is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k government supervision and regulation the following discussion describes among other things elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bhcs financial holding companies banks and brokerdealers including specific information about bank of america we are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bhcs financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities us federal regulation of banks bhcs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund dif rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors as a registered financial holding company and bhc the corporation is subject to the supervision of and regular inspection by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve our us bank subsidiaries the banks organized as national banking associations are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the federal reserve in addition the federal reserve and the occ have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design implementation and board oversight of bhcs and national banks risk governance frameworks us financial holding companies and the companies under their control are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature as defined by the grammleachbliley act and related federal reserve interpretations the corporations status as a financial holding company is conditioned upon maintaining certain eligibility requirements for both the corporation and its us depository institution subsidiaries including minimum capital ratios supervisory ratings and in the case of the depository institutions at least satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings failure to be an eligible financial holding company could result in the federal reserve limiting bank of americas activities including potential acquisitions the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased over the past several years beginning with the response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes in addition the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines many of these changes have occurred as a result of the 2010 doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the financial reform act we cannot assess whether there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision we are also subject to various other laws and regulations as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities management and ability to make distributions to shareholders for instance our brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to both us and international regulation including supervision by the sec financial industry regulatory authority and new york stock exchange among others our futures commission merchant subsidiaries supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the us are subject to regulation by and supervision of the us commodity futures trading commission cftc national futures association the chicago mercantile exchange and in the case of the banks certain banking regulators our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb our nonus businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges prudential regulators central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate for example our financial services entities in the united kingdom uk ireland and france are subject to regulation by the prudential regulatory authority and financial conduct authority the european central bank and central bank of ireland and the autorit de contrle prudentiel et de rsolution and autorit des marchs financiers respectively source of strength under the financial reform act and federal reserve policy bhcs are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 fdicia in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions transactions with affiliates pursuant to section 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by the federal reserves regulation w the banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the banks and their nonbank affiliates in general us banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving their nonbank affiliates additionally transactions between us banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arms length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness deposit insurance deposits placed at us domiciled banks are insured by the fdic subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the fdics regulations pursuant to the financial reform act fdic insurance coverage limits are 250000 per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category all insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic in order to fund the dif the fdic is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the dif to insured deposits in the us the fdic adopted regulations that establish a longterm target dif ratio of greater than two percent as of the date of this report the dif ratio is below this required target and the fdic has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the fdic and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole for more information regarding deposit insurance see ',\n",
       " '1a': 'item 1a risk factors  regulatory compliance and legal on page 18 bank of america 4 capital liquidity and operational requirements as a financial holding company we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity rules issued by the federal reserve and other us banking regulators including the occ and the fdic these rules are complex and are evolving as us and international regulatory authorities propose and enact amendments to these rules the corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory rules and to support our business activities these continually evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the corporation for more information on regulatory capital rules capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes see capital management on page 49 and note 16  regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference in this item 1 distributions we are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases for instance federal reserve regulations require major us bhcs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar our ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and noncapital standards established under the fdicia to the extent that the federal reserve increases our stress capital buffer scb global systemically important bank gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may impact the level of our scb additionally the federal reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing common stock dividends or repurchasing common stock for example as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic in the second half of 2020 the federal reserve introduced certain limitations to capital distributions for all large banks including the corporation which were removed effective july 1 2021 if the federal reserve finds that any of our banks are not wellcapitalized or wellmanaged we would be required to enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities additionally the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bhc that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof for more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends including the minimum capital requirements see note 13  shareholders equity and note 16  regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries the rights of the corporation our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries are further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries resolution planning as a bhc with greater than 250 billion of assets the corporation is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the bhc including the continued operations or solvent wind down of its material entities pursuant to the us bankruptcy code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that the bhcs plan is not credible the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations a summary of our plan is available on the federal reserve and fdic websites the fdic also requires the submission of a resolution plan for bank of america national association bana which must describe how the insured depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the federal deposit insurance act a description of this plan is available on the fdics website we continue to make substantial progress to enhance our resolvability which includes continued improvements to our preparedness capabilities to implement our resolution plan both from a financial and operational standpoint across international jurisdictions resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities ra among those the jurisdictions with the greatest impact to the corporations subsidiaries are the uk ireland and france where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locally incorporated subsidiaries as well as the corporations banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes as a result of the ras review of the submitted information we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years that could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries for more information regarding our resolution plan see item 1a risk factors  liquidity on page 10 insolvency and the orderly liquidation authority under the federal deposit insurance act the fdic may be appointed receiver of an insured depository institution if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances in addition under the financial reform act when a systemically important financial institution sifi such as the corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations the orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the federal deposit insurance act but also adopts certain concepts from the us bankruptcy code 5 bank of america the orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the us bankruptcy code for example in certain circumstances the fdic could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant eg shortterm creditors or operating creditors in lieu of paying other obligations eg longterm creditors without the need to obtain creditors consent or prior court review the insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a bhcs outstanding equity as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt under the fdics single point of entry strategy for resolving sifis the fdic could replace a distressed bhc with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original bhc furthermore the federal reserve requires that bhcs maintain minimum levels of longterm debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a

financial contracts in resolution could impede orderly resolution of gsibs and additional jurisdictions are expected to follow suit in addition the eu has implemented euwide resolution stay requirements generally these resolution stay regulations require amendment of certain financial contracts to provide for contractual recognition of stays of termination rights under various statutory resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise of crossdefault rights based on an affiliates entry into insolvency proceedings as resolution stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction applicable to

of the corporations material risk factors set forth below coronavirus disease the impacts of the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect us and the pandemics duration and future impacts remain uncertain since the onset of the pandemic the negative economic conditions and disruptions arising from it have adversely impacted our financial results to varying degrees and in various respects including as a result of periods of increased allowance for credit losses followed by subsequent declines and continued elevated noninterest expense the pandemics impact on economic conditions and activity remains uncertain and will continue to evolve by region country and state and it is possible that new or evolving variants of covid19 could result in increased business disruptions and contribute to a potential economic downturn in recent months the us and other regions of the world have experienced supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and the global economy and supply chains remain vulnerable pandemic developments and certain responses have also resulted in inflationary pressure and ultimately may contribute to the development of a prolonged disruptive period of high inflation in the us and globally the economic impact of the pandemic may continue to adversely affect certain of our businesses and our results of operations including decreased demand for and use of our products and services lower fees including asset management fees lower sales and trading revenue due to decreased market liquidity resulting from heightened volatility higher levels of uncollectible reversed charges in our merchant services business increased noninterest expense including operational losses and increased credit losses due to a deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers which could result in their inability to fulfill contractual obligations may vary by region sector or industry and could be exacerbated by the expiration of government assistance additionally our liquidity andor regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by customers withdrawal of deposits inability to repay loans and reduced usage of banking products volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets changes in the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments resulting in increased margin requirements volatility in foreign exchange rates and customer draws on lines of credit adverse macroeconomic conditions could also result in potential downgrades to our credit ratings negative impacts to regulatory capital and liquidity and reinstated restrictions on dividends andor common stock repurchases we continue to execute business continuity plans in connection with the pandemic if we become unable to operate our businesses from remote locations including for example because of an internal or external failure of our information technology infrastructure we experience increased rates of employee illness or unavailability or governmental restrictions are placed on our employees or operations our business continuity plans could be adversely affected and result in disruption to our businesses additionally we continue to rely on third parties who could experience business interruptions as a result of the pandemic which could increase our risks and adversely impact our businesses in connection with the pandemic various governmental fiscal and monetary relief programs were implemented in an effort to stimulate the global economy and avert negative economic or market conditions our participation in such programs could result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings and has resulted in and may continue to result in litigation including class actions such actions may result in judgments orders settlements penalties and fines our participation in such programs has also resulted and will continue to result in losses including from the paycheck protection program ppp and the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states we continue to closely monitor the pandemic and related risks as they evolve globally and in the us the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its future direct and indirect effects on global health the global economy and our businesses results of operations and financial condition are uncertain and depend on future developments that cannot be predicted including the likelihood of future surges of covid19 cases and the spread of more easily communicable andor dangerous variants of covid19 the availability usage and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines including additional doses of vaccines in the us and globally and future public response and government actions including travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity vaccine mandates and additional stimulus legislation the pandemic may cause setbacks to the global or national economic recovery or longer lasting effects on economic conditions than are currently anticipated changes in financial markets changes in fiscal monetary and tax regulatory environments and changes in client preferences and behavior which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition market our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the financial markets fiscal monetary and regulatory policies and economic conditions generally general economic political social and health conditions in the us and in one or more countries abroad affect markets in the us and abroad and our business in particular markets in the us or abroad may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates availability and market conditions of financing unexpected changes in gross domestic product gdp economic growth or its sustainability inflation supply chain disruptions consumer spending employment levels labor shortages wage stagnation federal government shutdowns developments related to the us federal debt ceiling energy prices home prices commercial property values bankruptcies a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity of the global financial markets the growth of global trade and commerce trade policies the availability and cost of capital and credit disruption of communication transportation or energy infrastructure and bank of america 8 investor sentiment and confidence additionally global markets including energy and commodity markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change extreme weather events or natural disasters the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics cyberattacks or campaigns military conflict including escalating military tension between russia and ukraine terrorism or other geopolitical events market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity also any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the us or abroad as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including capital and liquidity levels for example global developments in connection with the ongoing pandemic including supply chain disruptions high inflation changes to industries such as commercial real estate the emergence of new variants and significant restrictions on households and businesses in certain countries have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions globally actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate balance sheet management and lending facilities and other central banks are beyond our control and difficult to predict these actions can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities and can impact our borrowers sudden changes in monetary policy for example in response to high inflation could lead to financial market volatility increases in market interest rates and a flattening or inversion of the yield curve the continued protracted period of lower interest rates has resulted in lower revenue through lower net interest income which has adversely affected our results of operations continued low us interest rates potentially resulting from a further extended period of accommodative monetary policy andor an economic downturn could have a further adverse impact on us including our net interest income and results of operations changes to existing us laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities including those related to financial regulation taxation international trade fiscal policy climate change including required reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and healthcare may adversely impact us or global economic activity and our customers our counterparties and our earnings and operations for example the expiration of pandemicrelated government assistance in the us could result in a reduction in economic activity and lead to a deterioration in households finances particularly if consumers also continue to face high inflation a slowdown in consumer demand could limit the ability of firms to pass on fastrising costs for labor and other inputs weighing on earnings and potentially leading to an equity market downturn significant fiscal policy changes andor initiatives may also raise the federal debt affect businesses and household aftertax incomes and increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of us monetary policy and volatility of interest rates a rise in us interest rates could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating us dollar changes or proposed changes to certain us trade and international investment policies particularly with important trading partners including china and the eu have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets an escalation of tensions could lead to further measures that adversely affect financial markets disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation including through the use of tariffs foreign exchange measures or the largescale sale of us treasury bonds actions taken by other countries particularly china to restrict the activities of businesses could also negatively affect financial markets any of these developments could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses our customers our securities and derivatives portfolios including the risk of lower reinvestment rates within those portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels our liquidity and our results of operations additionally the transition from ibors and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates arrs could negatively impact markets globally and our business andor magnify any negative impact of the above referenced factors on our business customers and results of operations increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk our liquidity competitive position business results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates fluctuations significant or otherwise in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors these market risks may adversely affect among other things the value of our securities trading assets and other financial instruments the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets the value of assets under management aum fee income relating to aum customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives the volume of client activity in our trading operations investment banking fees the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing for example the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates if the federal reserve or a nonus central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected which could adversely impact the value of such assets changes to fiscal policy including expansion of us federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance could also affect market interest rates in addition although some interest rates have begun to rise and elevated inflation could lead to further increases the continued low interest rate environment has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations including on future revenue and earnings growth a flattening or inversion of the yield curve could also negatively impact our results of operations including revenue and earnings we use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa these types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses these changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours in these and other cases it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets to the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions 9 bank of america we may incur losses if asset values decline including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds we have a large portfolio of financial instruments including loans and loan commitments securities financing agreements assetbacked secured financings derivative assets and liabilities debt securities marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value that are subject to valuation and impairment assessments we determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance which for financial instruments measured at fair value requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements the fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity credit quality funding impact on certain derivatives and other transactionspecific factors where appropriate gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations unless we have effectively hedged our exposures increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt in addition increases in interest rates or changes in spreads may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as available for sale may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels these market moves also may adversely impact the value of debt securities we hold to meet regulatory liquidity requirements decreases in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain assets and therefore may adversely affect net interest income fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices the financial strength of counterparties with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets also will affect the fair value of these assets sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets which may make it difficult to sell hedge or value these assets the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our riskweighted assets rwa which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs values of aum also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for assetbased management and performance fees declines in values of aum can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets liquidity if we are unable to access the capital markets or continue to maintain deposits or our borrowing costs increase our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected liquidity is essential to our businesses we fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets we rely on certain secured funding sources such as repo markets which are typically shortterm and creditsensitive we also engage in asset securitization transactions including with the gses to fund consumer lending activities our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements including as a result of credit concerns for shortterm borrowing changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile prolonged federal government shutdowns or changes in regulations guidance or gse status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources additionally our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit slower customer payment rates restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds which could result from customer attrition for higher yields the desire for more conservative alternatives changes in customer behavior or our customers increased need for cash increased regulatory liquidity capital and margin requirements for our us or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or default by a significant market participant or third party including clearing agents custodians central banks or central counterparties ccps these factors also have the potential to increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our liquidity several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control such as general market volatility disruption shock or stress the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics federal reserve policy decisions including fluctuations in interest rates or federal reserve balance sheet composition negative views or loss of confidence about the corporation including short and longterm business prospects or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us the impact of these events whether within our control or not could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments unforeseen outflows of cash the need to draw on liquidity facilities the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls among other things the result of which could be increased costs a liquidity shortfall andor impact on our liquidity coverage ratio our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market conditions including changes in interest and currency exchange rates significant fluctuations in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads credit spreads reflect the published credit ratings or other assessments of credit risk and relative value by market participants of the corporation and represent the risk premiums that our funding providers demand in excess of a benchmark interest rate for example us treasury securities rates increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in marktomarket or credit valuation adjustment exposures changes in our credit spreads are marketdriven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness including changes in our credit ratings changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile we may also experience spread compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits due to increased marketplace rate competition additionally concentrations within our funding bank of america 10 profile such as maturities currencies or counterparties can reduce our funding efficiency reduction in our credit ratings could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings in addition credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions including otc derivatives credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and asset securitizations our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations and factors not under our control such as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment including any continued macroeconomic stress caused by the pandemic or changes the rating agencies may make to the methodologies they use to determine our ratings rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any downgrades could occur a reduction in certain of our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity access to credit markets the related cost of funds our businesses and certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical if the shortterm credit ratings of our parent company or bank or brokerdealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels we may experience loss of access to shortterm funding sources such as repo financing andor incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements under the terms of certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements if our or our subsidiaries credit ratings are downgraded the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain as they depend upon numerous dynamic complex and interrelated factors and assumptions including whether any downgrade of a firms longterm credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its shortterm credit ratings and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers investors and counterparties bank of america corporation is a holding company is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries bank of america corporation as the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries we evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal regulatory contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another including the parent company which could result in adverse liquidity events the parent company depends on dividends distributions loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations including debt obligations any inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions additional restrictions on related party transactions increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts as well as lower earnings can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries also regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and to pay obligations could be materially adversely affected in the event of a resolution bank of america corporation our parent holding company is required to periodically submit a plan to the fdic and federal reserve describing its resolution strategy under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure in the current plan bank of america corporations preferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry strategy this strategy provides that only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the us bankruptcy code and contemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company bank of america corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries pursuant to these arrangements if bank of america corporations liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent bank of america corporation will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a whollyowned holding company subsidiary which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to return capital to shareholders including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the corporations common stock and meet our payment obligations if the fdic and federal reserve jointly determine that bank of america corporations resolution plan is not credible they could impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations we could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and could potentially result in the divestiture of certain assets or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries additionally under the financial reform act when a gsib such as bank of america corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct 11 bank of america an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations in 2013 the fdic issued a notice describing its preferred single point of entry strategy for resolving a gsib under this approach the fdic could replace bank of america corporation with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors the fdics single point of entry strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy to the extent that the corporation is resolved under the us bankruptcy code or the fdics orderly liquidation authority thirdparty creditors of the corporations subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims while security holders of bank of america corporation could face significant or complete losses credit economic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses a number of our products expose us to credit risk including loans letters of credit derivatives debt securities trading account assets and assets heldforsale deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our credit portfolios may be impacted by global and us macroeconomic and market conditions events and disruptions including declines in gdp consumer spending or property values asset price corrections increasing consumer and corporate leverage increases in corporate bond spreads rising or elevated unemployment levels rising or elevated inflation fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates as well as widespread health emergencies or pandemics extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change and domestic and global efforts to transition to a lowcarbon economy significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets which could impact the underlying credit quality of our borrowers counterparties and assets property value declines or asset price corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us and could decrease the value of the collateral we hold which could increase credit losses credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices including property or collateral values unrelated to macroeconomic stress simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit andor an increase in a borrowers leverage in a weakening economic environment could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our credit portfolios including consumer credit card home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses although macroeconomic conditions have improved during 2021 in comparison to 2020 the pandemic and the related impacts of inflationary conditions high input costs and supply chain disruptions unemployment or labor shortages and the expiration of pandemicrelated government benefits and programs could negatively impact the ability of consumer and commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations additionally the pandemic continues to impact the economy and certain sectors remain at risk eg travel and entertainment as well as commercial real estate office exposure to the extent the pandemic worsens as a result of new variants or otherwise resulting in restrictions on economic activity or other negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment our credit portfolio and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted we establish an allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in our relevant financial assets the process to determine the allowance for credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated this includes forecasting how borrowers or counterparties will perform in changing and unprecedented economic conditions such as predicting developments in public health and fiscal policy related to the pandemic the ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates there is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties which similarly could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates if the models estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties which are more sensitive due to the current macroeconomic environment including as a result of the uncertainty regarding the magnitude and duration of the pandemic prove inaccurate in predicting future events we may suffer unexpected losses in addition changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of expected credit losses however there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly and quickly in such an event we may increase our allowance which would reduce our earnings additionally to the extent that economic conditions worsen as a result of covid19 or otherwise impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral and credit losses are worse than expected we may increase our provision for credit losses which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively impact our financial condition our concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses results of operations and financial condition in the ordinary course of our business we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic financial public health or business developments for example concentrations of credit risk may reside in a particular industry geography product asset class counterparty or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry geographic location product or asset class or a failure or downgrade of or default by any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated bank of america 12 while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry predominantly comprised of brokerdealers commercial banks investment banks insurers mutual funds hedge funds central clearing counterparties and other institutional clients resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to these industries financial services institutions and other counterparties are interrelated because of trading funding clearing or other relationships as a result defaults by one or more counterparties or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally could lead to marketwide liquidity disruptions losses and defaults many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us which may occur as a result of events that impact the value of the collateral such as an asset price correction or fraud further disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral our commercial portfolios include exposures to certain industries including asset managers and funds real estate finance companies and capital goods economic weaknesses sustained elevated inflation adverse business conditions market disruptions rising interest or capitalization rates the collapse of speculative bubbles greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in cash flow and higher credit losses in either our consumer or commercial portfolios or cause us to write down the value of certain assets additionally we could experience continued and longterm negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that continue to be disproportionately impacted by covid19 or are permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences resulting from covid19 eg travel and entertainment as well as commercial real estate office exposure or other industry disruptions furthermore we have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate auto consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio the us has experienced a meaningful increase in property prices over the past year and a decrease in home price valuations or commercial real estate valuations in certain markets where we have large concentrations as well as more broadly within the us or globally could result in increased servicing expenses defaults delinquencies or credit losses in particular the impact of climate change such as rising average global temperatures and rising sea levels and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters such as droughts floods wildfires and hurricanes could negatively impact collateral the valuations of home prices or commercial real estate or our customers ability andor willingness to pay fees outstanding loans or afford new products this could also cause insurability risk andor increased insurance costs to customers we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations us states and municipalities unfavorable economic or political conditions disruptions to capital markets currency fluctuations changes in oil prices social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of our positions leading to increased concentrations which could increase the credit and market risk associated with our positions as well as increase our rwa we may be adversely affected if the us housing market weakens or home prices decline although the us has experienced a meaningful increase in home prices in 2021 we remain conscious of geographic markets where housing price growth has increased significantly that could be vulnerable to declines in future periods and may negatively impact the demand and underlying collateral for many of our products additionally our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market both of which may be adversely affected by rising interest rates any downturn in the condition of the us housing market similar to the 2008 financial crisis or otherwise could result in both significant writedowns of asset values in several asset classes notably mortgagebacked securities and exposure to monolines if the us housing market were to weaken the value of real estate could decline which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses we are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events such as a change in the credit rating of the corporation or one or more of its affiliates we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions and could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks in some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements we are also a member of various central counterparties ccps in part due to regulatory requirements for mandatory clearing of derivative transactions which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to ccps in the event that one or more members of the ccp defaults on its obligations we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default a ccp may modify in its discretion the margin we are required to post which could mean unexpected and increased exposure to the ccp as a clearing member we are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our clients for which we clear transactions which may not be covered by 13 bank of america available collateral additionally default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses geopolitical we are subject to numerous political economic market reputational operational compliance legal regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate we do business throughout the world including in emerging markets economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally resulting in among other things market volatility reduced market value and economic output our liquidity and credit risk could be adversely impacted by and our businesses and revenues derived from nonus jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from financial social or judicial instability changes in government leadership including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization andor confiscation of assets price controls high inflation natural disasters the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics capital controls currency redenomination risk from a country exiting the eu or otherwise currency fluctuations foreign exchange controls or movements caused by devaluation or depegging unfavorable political and diplomatic developments oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation these risks are especially elevated in emerging markets additionally continued tensions between the us and important trading partners particularly china may result in sanctions further tariff increases or other restrictive actions on crossborder trade investment and transfer of information technology that weigh on trade volumes raise costs for producers and adversely affect our businesses and revenues as well as our customers and counterparties a number of nonus jurisdictions in which we do business have been or may be negatively impacted by slowing growth or recessionary conditions market volatility andor political or civil unrest the ongoing pandemic had a severe negative impact on global gdp and despite significant progress in 2021 it appears that the global economy faces an uncertain and uneven recovery ahead while the us and numerous other countries have recovered to prepandemic levels of output many countries and areas within countries are recovering more slowly economic weakness may prove persistent in many countries and regions including certain regions of europe japan and numerous emerging markets moreover economic activity remains vulnerable to ongoing public health uncertainties with respect to the pandemic and a number of countries are still imposing significant restrictions on residents and businesses global supply chain disruptions labor shortages wage pressures and elevated inflation in many countries pose further challenges especially in the form of volatility in financial markets additionally foreign exchange rates against the us dollar are at risk of significant depreciation as the federal reserve raises interest rates we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors furthermore the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly in emerging markets are generally smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations including our us operations market and economic disruptions of all types may affect consumer confidence levels and spending corporate investment and job creation bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt economic growth rates and asset values among other factors any such unfavorable conditions or developments could adversely impact us as a result of the pandemic and fiscal policy responses to it including the increased purchase of government bonds and other financial assets by central banks government debt levels have increased significantly raising the risk of volatility significant valuation changes political tensions among eu members regarding fiscal policy or defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt which could expose us to substantial losses our nonus businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments securities exchanges and regulators central banks and other regulatory bodies in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our potential inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses and changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations in that market as well as our reputation in general in connection with the uks exit from the eu we are now subject to different laws and regulations which are expected to diverge further over time and are subject to the oversight of additional regulatory authorities as political and regulatory environments evolve further changes to the legal and regulatory framework under which our subsidiaries provide products and services in the uk and in the eu may result in additional compliance costs and have negative tax consequences or an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition to nonus legislation our international operations are also subject to us legal requirements which subjects us to operational and compliance costs and risks for example our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to bribery and corruption antimoney laundering and economic sanctions which can vary by jurisdiction the increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heighten financial crimes risk our ability to comply with these legal requirements depends on our ability to continually improve surveillance detection and reporting and analytic capabilities in the us debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns which have increased the possibility of us government defaults on its debt andor downgrades to its credit ratings and prolonged government shutdowns could weaken the us dollar cause market volatility negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition including our liquidity additionally changes in fiscal monetary or regulatory policy including as a result of labor shortages wage pressures supply chain disruptions and higher inflation could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations organizational structure and results of operations we are also subject to geopolitical risks including economic sanctions acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism actions taken by the us or other governments in response thereto statesponsored cyberattacks or campaigns civil unrest andor military conflicts which could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad and in the us for example escalating military tensions between russia and ukraine could result in regional instability and adversely impact bank of america 14 commodity and other financial markets as well as economic conditions especially in europe additionally this could magnify inflationary pressure resulting from the pandemic and extend any prolonged period of higher inflation business operations a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or business continuity plans or those of third parties or the financial services industry could disrupt our critical business operations and customer services result in additional risk exposures and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry infrastructure our operational and security systems infrastructure including our computer systems emerging technologies data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance we also rely on our employees and third parties including downstream service providers in our daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct including errors in judgment malice fraudulent activity andor engaging in violations of applicable policies laws rules or procedures malfeasance or a failure or breach of systems or infrastructure cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational losses regulatory risk and reputational harm the corporations and third parties inability to properly introduce deploy and manage changes to internal financial and governance processes existing products services and technology as well as new product innovations and technology could also result in additional operational and regulatory risk additionally our financial accounting data processing and transmission storage backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely may be ineffective or fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third partys control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services we could also experience prolonged computer and network outages resulting in disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services including abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms we may experience sudden increases in customer transaction volume or electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware or software failure of aging infrastructure and technology project implementation challenges which could result in prolonged operational outages climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires tornadoes hurricanes and floods which could result in increased exposure to operational risks including outages additionally events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including civil unrest and terrorist acts could result in operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages we continue to execute our business continuity plans due to the pandemic and will likely continue to be subject to heightened operational risks to the extent that the pandemic persists we also continue to have greater reliance on remote access tools and technology and employees personal systems and increased data utilization and be increasingly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses remotely due to the increased number of employees who work from home and evolving customer preferences including increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses effective management of our business continuity depends on the security reliability and adequacy of such systems we also continue to be at risk of business disruptions due to illness and unavailability as the pandemic persists including from the emergence of new variants particularly if they are more transmissible andor severe regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training procedures backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties including their downstream service providers with whom we interact or upon whom we rely including systemic cyber events that result in system outages and unavailability of part or all of the internet cloud services andor the financial services industry infrastructure including critical banking activities our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with respect to our own systems furthermore to the extent that backup systems are available and utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up we regularly update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations globally this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or business continuity plans resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and customer services andor failure to identify and effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner could expose us to market abuse regulatory market privacy and liquidity risk and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk result in the disclosure andor misuse of information andor fraudulent activity and increase our operational and security systems and critical infrastructure costs our business is highly dependent on the security controls and efficacy of our infrastructure computer and data management systems as well as those of our customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties including their downstream service providers the financial services industry and financial data aggregators with whom we interact on whom we rely or who have access to our customers personal or account information our business relies on effective access management and the secure collection processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary personally identifiable and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to remotely access our network products and services our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our 15 bank of america network and control environments and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our employees customers regulators and third parties including providers of products and services are regularly the target of an increasing number of cyber threats and attacks and will continue to be cyber threats and techniques used in cyberattacks are pervasive sophisticated rapidly evolving difficult to prevent and include computer viruses malicious or destructive code such as ransomware social engineering including phishing vishing and smishing denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that could result in disruptions to our businesses and operations the loss of funds of the corporation andor its clients and the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction or theft of confidential proprietary and other information including intellectual property of ours our employees our customers or of third parties cybersecurity risks have also significantly increased in recent years in part due to the growing number and increasingly sophisticated activities of malicious cyber actors including organized crime groups hackers terrorist organizations extremist parties hostile foreign governments and statesponsored actors in some instances acting to promote political ends responding to policies andor actions of the us government we are also subject to cyberattacks by disgruntled employees activists and other third parties including those involved in corporate espionage our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of among other things the evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber threats our prominent size and scale our highprofile brand our geographic footprint and international presence and our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy the financial services industry including the corporation is particularly at risk because of the use of and reliance on digital banking and other digital services including mobile banking products such as mobile payments and other web and cloudbased products and applications and the development of additional remote connectivity solutions which increase cybersecurity risks and exposure acceptance and use of such digital banking products and services has substantially increased since the onset of the pandemic additionally the proliferation of thirdparty financial data aggregators and emerging technologies including our use of automation artificial intelligence ai and robotics increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure we continue to execute our business continuity plans due to the pandemic accordingly our risk and exposure to cyberattacks and security breaches remain magnified due to our continued reliance on remote access tools and technology resulting in increased reliance on virtualdigital interactions and a larger number of access points to our networks that must be secured this increased risk of unauthorized access to our networks results in greater amounts of information being available for access including from employees personal devices over which we do not have the same controls as we do when a larger employee population is working from our offices greater demand on our information technology infrastructure and security tools and processes will likely continue as the pandemic persists and may be experienced permanently we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry with whom we do business upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely other indirect risks relate to providers of products andor services financial counterparties financial data aggregators financial intermediaries such as clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses regulators providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power and retailers for whom we process transactions we are also at additional risk resulting from critical thirdparty information security and opensource software vulnerabilities additionally we have exposure to cyber threats as a result of our continuous transmission of sensitive information to and storage of such information by third parties including providers of products andor services and regulators the outsourcing of some of our business operations and system and customer account updates and conversions further any such event may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner similarly any failure cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises our systems or data could adversely impact third parties counterparties and the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other information or security vulnerability failure or breach that significantly exposes degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities or third parties or their downstream service providers could have a material impact on us our counterparties or other market participants and ultimately have an adverse impact on financial stability in the us andor globally this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis cyber threats and the techniques used in cyberattacks change rapidly despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate or detect cyberattacks or information or security breaches and implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address or mitigate such attacks or breaches even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data cyberattacks or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected it could take considerable additional time for us to determine the scope extent amount and type of information compromised at which time the impact on the corporation and measures to recover and restore to a businessasusual state may be difficult to assess as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional money and resources to modify or enhance our protective measures investigate and remediate any information security software or network vulnerabilities or incidents whether specific to us a third party the industry or businesses in general and develop our capabilities to respond and recover as a result increasing resources to develop and enhance our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems workstations intellectual property and proprietary information software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remains a critical priority although to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor bank of america 16 and mitigate the risks of cyber threats including the remediation of critical information security and software vulnerabilities will be sufficient andor timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future successful penetration or circumvention of system security could result in negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities the withdrawal of customer deposits misappropriation or destruction of our intellectual property proprietary information or confidential information andor the confidential proprietary or personally identifiable information of certain parties such as our employees customers providers of products and services counterparties and other third parties or damage to their computers or systems also any technology failure cyberattack successful penetration or circumvention of our networks and systems or other information or security breach termination or constraint of any third party including their downstream service providers the financial services industry infrastructure or financial data aggregators could among other things adversely affect our ability to conduct daytoday business activities effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses result in fraudulent or unauthorized transactions or cause prolonged computer and network outages resulting in material disruptions to our or our customers or other third parties network access or critical business operations and customer services in the us andor globally cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in significant lost revenue give rise to losses and claims brought by third parties litigation exposure government fines penalties or intervention and other negative consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyberattack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business andor result in the loss of confidence in our security measures additionally our failure to communicate cyber incidents appropriately to relevant parties could result in regulatory privacy operational and reputational risk although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate cyberattacks or other information or security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws in the us and abroad reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage securitizations loans owned by other entities and other losses we could incur as servicer could adversely impact our reputation servicing costs or results of operations we and our legacy companies service mortgage loans on behalf of thirdparty securitization vehicles and other investors if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice which could cause us to lose servicing income in addition we may have liability for any failure by us as a servicer or master servicer for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties if any such breach was found to have occurred it may harm our reputation increase our servicing costs result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations additionally with respect to foreclosures we may incur costs or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process we may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure changes in the structure of and relationship among the gses could adversely impact our business during 2021 we sold approximately 32 billion of loans to gses primarily freddie mac fhlmc fhlmc and fannie mae fnma are currently in conservatorship with their primary regulator the federal housing finance agency fhfa acting as conservator in september 2019 the treasury department published a proposal to recapitalize fhlmc and fnma and remove them from conservatorship as well as reduce their role in the marketplace consistent with this proposal in january 2021 the treasury department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of fhlmc and fnma and delineated the continued objective to remove the gses from conservatorship however we cannot predict the future prospects of the gses timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the gses in the housing market additionally if the gses were to take a reduced role in the marketplace including by limiting the mortgage products they offer we could be required to seek alternative funding sources retain additional loans on our balance sheet secure funding through the federal home loan bank system or securitize the loans through private label securitization accordingly uncertainty regarding their future and the mortgagebacked securities they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future any of these developments could adversely affect the value of our securities portfolios capital levels liquidity and results of operations our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us we seek to effectively and consistently identify measure monitor report and control the types of risk to which we are subject including strategic credit legal climate market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks while we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques including modeling and forecasting hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify all risks including emerging and unknown risks anticipate the timing of risks apply effective hedging strategies make correct assumptions manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently and develop risk management models to assess and control risk our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the corporation and manage risks associated with third parties including their downstream service providers including providers of products andor services to enable effective risk management and ensure that risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner uncertain economic conditions heightened 17 bank of america legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry the pace of technological changes accounting and market developments the failure of employees to comply with our policies and risk framework and the overall complexity of our operations among other developments may result in a heightened level of risk for us we have experienced increased operational reputational and compliance risk as a result of the need to rapidly implement multiple and varying pandemic relief programs such as ppp and the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states which have resulted and will continue to result in losses in addition to the continued execution of our business continuity plans due to the pandemic our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate manage control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses regulatory compliance and legal we are subject to comprehensive government legislation and regulations and certain settlements orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time we are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate including increasing and complex economic sanctions regimes these laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities including the products and services we offer reduce certain fees and rates or make our products and services more expensive for our clients additionally we are required to file various financial and nonfinancial regulatory reports to comply with laws and rules in the jurisdictions in which we operate we continue to adjust our business and operations legal entity structure and our policies processes procedures and controls including with regard to capital and liquidity management risk management and data management to comply with currently effective laws and regulations as well as final rulemaking guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities including the department of treasury including the internal revenue service irs federal reserve occ cfpb financial stability oversight council fdic department of labor sec and cftc in the us and foreign regulators and other government authorities further we could become subject to future legislation and regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed adopted or contemplated in the us or abroad including policies and rulemaking related to the financial reform act the pandemic emerging technologies and climate change the cumulative effect of all of the legislation and regulations on our business operations and profitability remains uncertain this uncertainty necessitates that in our business planning we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of prospective and proposed rules if these assumptions prove incorrect we could be subject to increased regulatory and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm in addition us and international regulatory initiatives may overlap and nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed us regulations which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs our regulators prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions and they have assumed an active oversight inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry regulatory focus is not limited to laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry but extends to other significant laws and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions including those related to data management and privacy antimoney laundering anticorruption and economic sanctions we are also subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and abroad including gdpr ccpa and cpra and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws regarding compliance with our privacy policies and the disclosure collection use sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information of certain parties such as our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties the violation of which could result in litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions the complexity and risk of compliance has been magnified by the collection of employee health information in response to the pandemic additionally we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the us and abroad which could result in additional costs of compliance litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions in particular there is increased complexity and uncertainty including potential suspension or prohibition regarding the standards used by the corporation for crossborder flows and transfers of personal data from the european economic area eea to the us and other jurisdictions outside of the eea resulting from a decision of the court of justice of the eu and guidance from the european data protection board additionally the european commission has published new standards of personal data transfer and china and the uk have commenced consultation efforts to establish standards for personal data transfers if crossborder personal data transfers are suspended or restricted or we are required to implement distinct processes for each jurisdictions standards this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses additional costs increased enforcement activity new contract negotiations with third parties andor modification of our crossborder data management as part of their enforcement authority our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to among other things conduct investigations and assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties or restitution and issue cease and desist orders and initiate injunctive actions the amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have in some instances been substantial and may increase in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions which could have significant consequences including reputational harm loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time the corporation and the conduct of its employees and representatives including conduct that could harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions additionally actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities responding to inquiries investigations lawsuits and proceedings is timeconsuming and expensive and can divert senior management attention from our business the bank of america 18 outcome of such proceedings which may last a number of years may be difficult to predict or estimate we are and may become subject to the terms of settlements orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities which impose or could impose significant operational and compliance costs on us as they typically require us to enhance our procedures and controls expand our risk and control functions within our lines of business invest in technology and hire significant numbers of additional risk control and compliance personnel moreover if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements orders or agreements to which we are subject or more generally fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities we could be required to enter into further settlements orders or agreements and pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to identify assess monitor and report on employees conduct applicable laws policies and procedures compliance risks will continue to exist particularly as we adapt to new and evolving laws rules and regulations additionally changing us fiscal monetary and regulatory policies and evolving priorities may result in ongoing regulatory uncertainties there is no guarantee that our risk management and compliance programs will be consistently executed to successfully manage compliance risk we also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk future legislative or regulatory actions and any required changes to our business or operations or those of third parties including their downstream providers upon whom we rely resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities require us to dispose of or curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that we hold require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect our businesses in addition investigations legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time that may result in fines regulatory sanctions penalties equitable relief and changes to our business practices as a result we are and will continue to be subject to heightened compliance and operating costs that could adversely affect our results of operations we are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action we continue to face significant legal risks in our business with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions the amount of damages penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be high this includes disputes with consumers customers and other counterparties financial institutions including us continue to be the subject of claims alleging anticompetitive conduct with respect to various products and markets including us antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages as disclosed in note 12  commitments and contingencies to the

mortgages by legacy companies which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties in addition regulatory authorities have had a supervisory focus on enforcement including in connection with customer complaints alleged violations of law and customer harm for example us regulators and government agencies have pursued claims against financial institutions under the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act the false claims act fair lending laws and regulations including the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act antitrust laws and consumer protection laws and regulations including prohibitions on unfair deceptive andor abusive acts and practices under the consumer financial protection act and the federal trade commission act such claims may carry significant and in certain cases treble damages there is also an increased focus on compliance with global laws rules and regulations related to the collection use sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data additionally misconduct by the corporations employees and representatives including unethical fraudulent improper or illegal conduct or other unfair deceptive abusive or discriminatory business practices can result in litigation andor government investigations and enforcement actions and cause significant reputational harm there is also increased scrutiny of climate changerelated policies goals and disclosure which could result in litigation and regulatory investigations and actions the global environment of extensive investigations regulation regulatory compliance burdens litigation and regulatory enforcement combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment have affected and will likely continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks including the limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely continue to result in judgments orders settlements penalties and fines adverse to us further the corporations participation in implementing government relief measures related to the pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states may lead to additional such judgments orders settlements penalties and fines litigation and investigation costs substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition including liquidity and results of

requirements we are subject to us regulatory capital and liquidity rules these rules among other things establish minimum requirements to qualify as a wellcapitalized institution if any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fails to maintain its status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules the federal reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to wellcapitalized status for the duration of such an agreement the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our activities if we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement the federal reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities including 19 bank of america requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the bank holding company act of 1956 capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended it is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including tlac and longterm debt requirements change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers to the extent that increases occur in our scb gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease for example our gsib surcharge is expected to increase by 50 basis points to 30 percent on january 1 2024 as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may impact the level of our scb requiring us to hold additional capital additionally the federal reserve could reinstitute limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock as a result of the economic impact of the ongoing pandemic or otherwise impose such limitations in connection with other economic disruptions or events a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our rwa and our leverage exposure which may increase the basel committee on banking supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring rwa that have not yet been implemented in the us including a standardized approach for operational risk revised market risk requirements and constraints on the use of internal models as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches us banking regulators may update the us basel 3 rules to incorporate the basel committee revisions banks have experienced an increase in balance sheets increasing leverage exposures and causing leveragebased ratios to overtake riskbased capital ratios changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets increase borrowings issue additional equity or other securities cease or alter certain operations or hold highly liquid assets which may adversely affect our results of operations changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain if those assumptions estimates or judgments were misapplied we could be required to correct and restate priorperiod financial statements accounting standardsetters and those who interpret the accounting standards including the sec banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial statements in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively resulting in us revising priorperiod financial statements we may be adversely affected by changes in us and nonus tax laws and regulations it is possible that governmental authorities in the us andor other countries could further amend or repeal tax laws in a way that would materially adversely affect us including the possibility that aspects of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could be amended in the future any future change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our results of operations additionally us and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority this could result in additional tax liabilities and interest penalties the reduction of certain tax benefits andor the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded which could be material in addition we have uk net deferred tax assets dta which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors such as prolonged worsening of europes capital markets or changes in the ability of our uk subsidiaries to conduct business

harm our businesses including our competitive position and business prospects our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and employees is impacted by our reputation harm to our reputation can arise from various sources including officer director andor employee activities such as fraud misconduct and unethical behavior such as employees sales practices security breaches litigation or regulatory matters and their outcomes compensation practices lending practices the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies including the reliability of our research and models and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions additionally our reputation may be harmed by failing to deliver the products and standards of service and quality expected by our customers clients and the community the failure to recognize and address customer complaints compliance failures the inability to manage technology change or maintain effective data management cyber incidents prolonged or repeated system outages internal and external fraud inadequacy of responsiveness to internal controls unintended disclosure of personal proprietary or confidential information conflicts of interest and breach of fiduciary obligations the handling of health emergencies or pandemics and the activities of our clients customers counterparties and third parties including providers of products andor services for example our reputation may be harmed in connection with our implementation of government programs to provide relief to address the economic impact of the pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states as well as how we handle employee matters related to the pandemic our reputation may also be negatively impacted by our esg practices and disclosures our businesses bank of america 20 and our customers

financial results we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy fair lending activity udaap electronic funds transfers knowyourcustomer requirements data protection including the gdpr ccpa and cpra crossborder data movement and other matters principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices or that is inconsistent with one another if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession or in the possession of third parties including their downstream service providers or financial data aggregators is mishandled misused or mismanaged or if we do not timely or adequately address such information we may face regulatory reputational and operational risks which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues such as operational risks gives rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions legal risks and reputational harm which could among other consequences increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses other reforms to and replacement of ibors and certain other rates or indices may adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations there continues to be a major transition in progress in the global financial markets with respect to the replacement of ibors including the london interbank offered rate libor and certain other rates or indices that serve as benchmarks such benchmarks have been used extensively across the global financial markets and in our business in particular libor has historically been used in many of our products and contracts including derivatives consumer and commercial loans mortgages floatingrate notes and other adjustablerate products and financial instruments the aggregate notional amount of these products and contracts referencing libor or other ibors remains material to our business at the end of 2021 the global financial markets generally transitioned away from the use of all libor settings except for certain us dollar usd libor settings however there continue to be risks and challenges associated with the transition from ibors that may result in consequences that cannot be fully anticipated which expose us to various financial operational supervisory conduct and legal risks which we continue to monitor closely through a multiyear effort by the industry and regulators arrs have been identified andor developed and are being used to replace libor and other ibors however market and client adoption of arrs may vary across or within categories of contracts products and services resulting in market fragmentation decreased trading volumes and liquidity increased complexity and modeling and operational risks arrs have compositions and characteristics that differ from the benchmarks they replace in some cases have limited history and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace for example certain arrs are calculated on a compounded or weightedaverage basis and unlike ibors do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore typically require a spread adjustment there are important differences between the fallbacks triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets including within cash markets any mismatch between the adoption of arrs in loans securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented and as a result we may experience unanticipated market exposures changes resulting from transition to successor or alternative rates may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us amounts paid on securities we have issued amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into the value of such loans securities or derivative instruments the trading market for such products and contracts and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk there can be no assurance that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to ibors that have not already transitioned to arrs will successfully transition given the continuation of certain usd libor settings until june 30 2023 iborbased products and contracts ibor products linked to these libor settings will still have to be transitioned by such time although a significant majority of the aggregate notional amount of our iborbased products maturing after 2021 include or have been updated to include fallbacks to arrs the transitioning of certain ibor products that do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms will require additional efforts to modify their terms some outstanding ibor products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification to address such challenges in ibor products legislation has been adopted in various jurisdictions including the eu uk and new york state and federal legislation is pending in the us congress litigation disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation in particular if there is an overlap between laws in different jurisdictions some of our ibor products in particular liborbased products and contracts may contain language giving the calculation agent which may be us discretion to determine the successor rate including the arr andor the applicable spread adjustment to the existing benchmark we may face a risk of litigation disputes or other actions from clients counterparties customers investors or others based on various claims for example that the corporation incorrectly interpreted or enforced iborbased contract provisions failed to appropriately communicate the effect that the transition to arrs will have on 21 bank of america existing and future products treated affected parties unfairly or made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients or engaged in anticompetitive behavior or unlawfully manipulated markets or benchmarks we have launched and expect to continue to develop launch and support arrbased products and services there is no guarantee that liquidity in arrbased products will develop and it is possible that arrbased products including products using credit sensitive rates will perform differently to ibor products during times of economic stress adverse or volatile market conditions and across the credit and economic cycle which may impact the value return on and profitability of our arrbased assets new financial products linked to arrs may have additional legal financial tax operational market compliance reputational competitive or other risks to us our clients and other market participants in particular banking regulators in the us and globally have increased regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus of financial institution libor transition plans preparations and readiness including the corporations use of creditsensitive rates like the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index which could result in a regulatory action litigation andor the need to change the products offered by our businesses failure to meet industrywide ibor transition milestones and to cease issuance of ibor products by relevant cessation dates may subject to certain regulatory exceptions result in supervisory enforcement by applicable regulators increase our cost of and access to capital and other consequences the market transition may also alter our risk profile and risk management strategies including derivatives and hedging strategies modeling and analytics valuation tools product design and systems controls procedures and operational infrastructure this may prove challenging given the limited history of many of the proposed arrs and may increase the costs and risks related to potential regulatory compliance requirements or inquiries among other risks various ibor products transition to arrs at different times or in different manners with the result that we may face significant unexpected interest rate pricing or other exposures across business or product lines continuing reforms to market transition and other factors may adversely affect our business including the ability to serve customers and maintain market share financial condition or results of operations and could result in reputational harm to us we face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry we operate in a highly competitive environment and experience intense competition from local and global financial institutions as well as new entrants in both domestic and foreign markets in which we compete on the basis of a number of factors including customer service quality and range of products and services offered technology price fees reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits customer convenience and experience and relationships in relevant markets additionally the changing regulatory environment may create competitive disadvantages for us given geographydriven capital and liquidity requirements in addition emerging technologies and advances and the growth of ecommerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions made it easier for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed nontraditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internetbased financial solutions and services including electronic securities trading with low or no fees and commissions marketplace lending financial data aggregation and payment processing including realtime payment platforms further clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices fees commissions or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology andor reducing our market share or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us our inability to adapt our business strategies products and services could harm our business our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services delivered through multiple distribution channels our success depends on our and our thirdparty providers of products and services ability to adapt and develop our business strategies products services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences in particular the emergence of the pandemic has resulted in increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by the corporations businesses there is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services on more attractive terms including lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits and offer lower cost investment strategies which may impact our ability to grow revenue andor effectively compete additionally legislative and regulatory developments may affect the competitive landscape and impact the products and services that we can offer further we may be impacted by the growth of nondepository institutions that offer traditional banking products at higher rates or with low or no fees or otherwise offer alternative products this can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our feebased products and services either from a decrease in the volume of transactions or through a compression of spreads the widespread adoption and rapid evolution of new technologies including analytic capabilities selfservice digital trading platforms internet services distributed ledgers such as the blockchain system cryptocurrencies central bank digital currencies cbdcs and payment systems could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our online and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions as cbdc initiatives evolve and

extensive regulatory framework applicable to bhcs financial holding companies banks and brokerdealers including specific information about bank of america we are subject to an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bhcs financial holding companies and banks and other financial services entities us federal regulation of banks bhcs and financial holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund dif rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors as a registered financial holding company and bhc the corporation is subject to the supervision of and regular inspection by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve our us bank subsidiaries the banks organized as national banking associations are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the federal reserve in addition the federal reserve and the occ have adopted guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design implementation and board oversight of bhcs and national banks risk governance frameworks us financial holding companies and the companies under their control are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature as defined by the grammleachbliley act and related federal reserve interpretations the corporations status as a financial holding company is conditioned upon maintaining certain eligibility requirements for both the corporation and its us depository institution subsidiaries including minimum capital ratios supervisory ratings and in the case of the depository institutions at least satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings failure to be an eligible financial holding company could result in the federal reserve limiting bank of americas activities including potential acquisitions the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased over the past several years beginning with the response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes in addition the banking and financial services sector is subject to substantial regulatory enforcement and fines many of these changes have occurred as a result of the 2010 doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the financial reform act we cannot assess whether there will be any additional major changes in the regulatory environment and expect that our business will remain subject to continuing and extensive regulation and supervision we are also subject to various other laws and regulations as well as supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies all of which directly or indirectly affect our entities management and ability to make distributions to shareholders for instance our brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to both us and international regulation including supervision by the sec financial industry regulatory authority and new york stock exchange among others our futures commission merchant subsidiaries supporting commodities and derivatives businesses in the us are subject to regulation by and supervision of the us commodity futures trading commission cftc national futures association the chicago mercantile exchange and in the case of the banks certain banking regulators our insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies and our consumer financial products and services are regulated by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb our nonus businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges prudential regulators central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate for example our financial services entities in the united kingdom uk ireland and france are subject to regulation by the prudential regulatory authority and financial conduct authority the european central bank and central bank of ireland and the autorit de contrle prudentiel et de rsolution and autorit des marchs financiers respectively source of strength under the financial reform act and federal reserve policy bhcs are expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of 1991 fdicia in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of default of a bank subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of default the affiliate banks of such a subsidiary may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions transactions with affiliates pursuant to section 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by the federal reserves regulation w the banks are subject to restrictions that limit certain types of transactions between the banks and their nonbank affiliates in general us banks are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving their nonbank affiliates additionally transactions between us banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arms length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness deposit insurance deposits placed at us domiciled banks are insured by the fdic subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the fdics regulations pursuant to the financial reform act fdic insurance coverage limits are 250000 per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category all insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic in order to fund the dif the fdic is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the dif to insured deposits in the us the fdic adopted regulations that establish a longterm target dif ratio of greater than two percent as of the date of this report the dif ratio is below this required target and the fdic has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the fdic and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole for more information regarding deposit insurance see item 1a risk factors  regulatory compliance and legal on page 18 bank of america 4 capital liquidity and operational requirements as a financial holding company we and our bank subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity rules issued by the federal reserve and other us banking regulators including the occ and the fdic these rules are complex and are evolving as us and international regulatory authorities propose and enact amendments to these rules the corporation seeks to manage its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to satisfy these regulatory rules and to support our business activities these continually evolving rules are likely to influence our planning processes and may require additional regulatory capital and liquidity as well as impose additional operational and compliance costs on the corporation for more information on regulatory capital rules capital composition and pending or proposed regulatory capital changes see capital management on page 49 and note 16  regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference in this item 1 distributions we are subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to capital actions including payment of dividends and common stock repurchases for instance federal reserve regulations require major us bhcs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar our ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and noncapital standards established under the fdicia to the extent that the federal reserve increases our stress capital buffer scb global systemically important bank gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may impact the level of our scb additionally the federal reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing common stock dividends or repurchasing common stock for example as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic in the second half of 2020 the federal reserve introduced certain limitations to capital distributions for all large banks including the corporation which were removed effective july 1 2021 if the federal reserve finds that any of our banks are not wellcapitalized or wellmanaged we would be required to enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities additionally the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bhc that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof for more information regarding the requirements relating to the payment of dividends including the minimum capital requirements see note 13  shareholders equity and note 16  regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries the rights of the corporation our shareholders and our creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of our subsidiaries are further subject to the prior claims of creditors of the respective subsidiaries resolution planning as a bhc with greater than 250 billion of assets the corporation is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the bhc including the continued operations or solvent wind down of its material entities pursuant to the us bankruptcy code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that the bhcs plan is not credible the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations a summary of our plan is available on the federal reserve and fdic websites the fdic also requires the submission of a resolution plan for bank of america national association bana which must describe how the insured depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the federal deposit insurance act a description of this plan is available on the fdics website we continue to make substantial progress to enhance our resolvability which includes continued improvements to our preparedness capabilities to implement our resolution plan both from a financial and operational standpoint across international jurisdictions resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities ra among those the jurisdictions with the greatest impact to the corporations subsidiaries are the uk ireland and france where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locally incorporated subsidiaries as well as the corporations banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes as a result of the ras review of the submitted information we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years that could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries for more information regarding our resolution plan see item 1a risk factors  liquidity on page 10 insolvency and the orderly liquidation authority under the federal deposit insurance act the fdic may be appointed receiver of an insured depository institution if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances in addition under the financial reform act when a systemically important financial institution sifi such as the corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations the orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the federal deposit insurance act but also adopts certain concepts from the us bankruptcy code 5 bank of america the orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the us bankruptcy code for example in certain circumstances the fdic could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant eg shortterm creditors or operating creditors in lieu of paying other obligations eg longterm creditors without the need to obtain creditors consent or prior court review the insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a bhcs outstanding equity as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt under the fdics single point of entry strategy for resolving sifis the fdic could replace a distressed bhc with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original bhc furthermore the federal reserve requires that bhcs maintain minimum levels of longterm debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution for more information regarding our resolution see item 1a risk factors  liquidity on page 10 limitations on acquisitions the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 permits a bhc to acquire banks located in states other than its home state without regard to state law subject to certain conditions including the condition that the bhc after and as a result of the acquisition controls no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state at june 30 2021 we held greater than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us in addition the financial reform act restricts acquisitions by a financial institution if as a result of the acquisition the total liabilities of the financial institution would exceed 10 percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the us at june 30 2021 our liabilities did not exceed 10 percent of the total liabilities of all financial institutions in the us the volcker rule the volcker rule prohibits insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions collectively banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of certain securities derivatives commodity futures and options for their own account the volcker rule also imposes limits on banking entities investments in and other relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds the volcker rule provides exemptions for certain activities including market making underwriting hedging trading in government obligations insurance company activities and organizing and offering hedge funds and private equity funds the volcker rule also clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited including acting as agent broker or custodian a banking entity with significant trading operations such as the corporation is required to maintain a detailed compliance program to comply with the restrictions of the volcker rule derivatives our derivatives operations are subject to extensive regulation globally these operations are subject to regulation under the financial reform act the european union eu markets in financial instruments directive and regulation the european market infrastructure regulation analogous uk regulatory regimes and similar regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions that regulate or will regulate the derivatives markets in which we operate by among other things requiring clearing and exchange trading of certain derivatives enforcing existing or imposing new capital margin reporting registration and business conduct requirements for certain market participants imposing position limits on certain overthecounter otc derivatives and imposing derivatives trading transparency requirements these regulations are already in effect in many markets in which we operate in addition many g20 jurisdictions including the us uk and japan have adopted resolution stay regulations to address concerns that the closeout of derivatives and other financial contracts in resolution could impede orderly resolution of gsibs and additional jurisdictions are expected to follow suit in addition the eu has implemented euwide resolution stay requirements generally these resolution stay regulations require amendment of certain financial contracts to provide for contractual recognition of stays of termination rights under various statutory resolution regimes and a stay on the exercise of crossdefault rights based on an affiliates entry into insolvency proceedings as resolution stay regulations of a particular jurisdiction applicable to us go into effect we amend impacted financial contracts in compliance with such regulations either as a regulated entity or as a counterparty facing a regulated entity in such jurisdiction consumer regulations our consumer businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by federal and state regulators certain federal consumer finance laws to which we are subject including the equal credit opportunity act home mortgage disclosure act electronic fund transfer act fair credit reporting act real estate settlement procedures act unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap

security we are subject to many us federal state and international laws and regulations governing requirements for maintaining policies and procedures regarding the disclosure use and protection of the nonpublic confidential information of our customers and employees the grammleachbliley act requires us to periodically disclose bank of americas privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances the grammleachbliley act and other laws also require us to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to provide the security and confidentiality of customer records and information security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations other laws and regulations at the international federal and state level impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or contact customers with marketing offers and establish certain rights of consumers in connection with their personal information for example californias consumer privacy act ccpa which went into effect in january 2020 as modified by the california privacy rights act cpra provides consumers with the right to know what personal data is being collected know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom and opt out of the sale of their personal data bank of america 6 among other rights in addition in the eu the general data protection regulation gdpr replaced the data protection directive and related implementing national laws in its member states the ccpas cpras and gdprs impact on the corporation was assessed and addressed through comprehensive compliance implementation programs these existing and evolving legal requirements in the us and abroad as well as court proceedings and changing guidance from regulatory bodies with respect to the validity of crossborder data transfer mechanisms from the eu continue to lend uncertainty to privacy compliance globally item 1a risk factors the discussion below addresses the corporations material risk factors of which we are aware any

of the corporations material risk factors set forth below coronavirus disease the impacts of the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect us and the pandemics duration and future impacts remain uncertain since the onset of the pandemic the negative economic conditions and disruptions arising from it have adversely impacted our financial results to varying degrees and in various respects including as a result of periods of increased allowance for credit losses followed by subsequent declines and continued elevated noninterest expense the pandemics impact on economic conditions and activity remains uncertain and will continue to evolve by region country and state and it is possible that new or evolving variants of covid19 could result in increased business disruptions and contribute to a potential economic downturn in recent months the us and other regions of the world have experienced supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and the global economy and supply chains remain vulnerable pandemic developments and certain responses have also resulted in inflationary pressure and ultimately may contribute to the development of a prolonged disruptive period of high inflation in the us and globally the economic impact of the pandemic may continue to adversely affect certain of our businesses and our results of operations including decreased demand for and use of our products and services lower fees including asset management fees lower sales and trading revenue due to decreased market liquidity resulting from heightened volatility higher levels of uncollectible reversed charges in our merchant services business increased noninterest expense including operational losses and increased credit losses due to a deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers which could result in their inability to fulfill contractual obligations may vary by region sector or industry and could be exacerbated by the expiration of government assistance additionally our liquidity andor regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by customers withdrawal of deposits inability to repay loans and reduced usage of banking products volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets changes in the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments resulting in increased margin requirements volatility in foreign exchange rates and customer draws on lines of credit adverse macroeconomic conditions could also result in potential downgrades to our credit ratings negative impacts to regulatory capital and liquidity and reinstated restrictions on dividends andor common stock repurchases we continue to execute business continuity plans in connection with the pandemic if we become unable to operate our businesses from remote locations including for example because of an internal or external failure of our information technology infrastructure we experience increased rates of employee illness or unavailability or governmental restrictions are placed on our employees or operations our business continuity plans could be adversely affected and result in disruption to our businesses additionally we continue to rely on third parties who could experience business interruptions as a result of the pandemic which could increase our risks and adversely impact our businesses in connection with the pandemic various governmental fiscal and monetary relief programs were implemented in an effort to stimulate the global economy and avert negative economic or market conditions our participation in such programs could result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings and has resulted in and may continue to result in litigation including class actions such actions may result in judgments orders settlements penalties and fines our participation in such programs has also resulted and will continue to result in losses including from the paycheck protection program ppp and the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states we continue to closely monitor the pandemic and related risks as they evolve globally and in the us the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its future direct and indirect effects on global health the global economy and our businesses results of operations and financial condition are uncertain and depend on future developments that cannot be predicted including the likelihood of future surges of covid19 cases and the spread of more easily communicable andor dangerous variants of covid19 the availability usage and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines including additional doses of vaccines in the us and globally and future public response and government actions including travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity vaccine mandates and additional stimulus legislation the pandemic may cause setbacks to the global or national economic recovery or longer lasting effects on economic conditions than are currently anticipated changes in financial markets changes in fiscal monetary and tax regulatory environments and changes in client preferences and behavior which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition market our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the financial markets fiscal monetary and regulatory policies and economic conditions generally general economic political social and health conditions in the us and in one or more countries abroad affect markets in the us and abroad and our business in particular markets in the us or abroad may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates availability and market conditions of financing unexpected changes in gross domestic product gdp economic growth or its sustainability inflation supply chain disruptions consumer spending employment levels labor shortages wage stagnation federal government shutdowns developments related to the us federal debt ceiling energy prices home prices commercial property values bankruptcies a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity of the global financial markets the growth of global trade and commerce trade policies the availability and cost of capital and credit disruption of communication transportation or energy infrastructure and bank of america 8 investor sentiment and confidence additionally global markets including energy and commodity markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change extreme weather events or natural disasters the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics cyberattacks or campaigns military conflict including escalating military tension between russia and ukraine terrorism or other geopolitical events market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity also any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the us or abroad as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including capital and liquidity levels for example global developments in connection with the ongoing pandemic including supply chain disruptions high inflation changes to industries such as commercial real estate the emergence of new variants and significant restrictions on households and businesses in certain countries have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions globally actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate balance sheet management and lending facilities and other central banks are beyond our control and difficult to predict these actions can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities and can impact our borrowers sudden changes in monetary policy for example in response to high inflation could lead to financial market volatility increases in market interest rates and a flattening or inversion of the yield curve the continued protracted period of lower interest rates has resulted in lower revenue through lower net interest income which has adversely affected our results of operations continued low us interest rates potentially resulting from a further extended period of accommodative monetary policy andor an economic downturn could have a further adverse impact on us including our net interest income and results of operations changes to existing us laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities including those related to financial regulation taxation international trade fiscal policy climate change including required reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and healthcare may adversely impact us or global economic activity and our customers our counterparties and our earnings and operations for example the expiration of pandemicrelated government assistance in the us could result in a reduction in economic activity and lead to a deterioration in households finances particularly if consumers also continue to face high inflation a slowdown in consumer demand could limit the ability of firms to pass on fastrising costs for labor and other inputs weighing on earnings and potentially leading to an equity market downturn significant fiscal policy changes andor initiatives may also raise the federal debt affect businesses and household aftertax incomes and increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of us monetary policy and volatility of interest rates a rise in us interest rates could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating us dollar changes or proposed changes to certain us trade and international investment policies particularly with important trading partners including china and the eu have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets an escalation of tensions could lead to further measures that adversely affect financial markets disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation including through the use of tariffs foreign exchange measures or the largescale sale of us treasury bonds actions taken by other countries particularly china to restrict the activities of businesses could also negatively affect financial markets any of these developments could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses our customers our securities and derivatives portfolios including the risk of lower reinvestment rates within those portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels our liquidity and our results of operations additionally the transition from ibors and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates arrs could negatively impact markets globally and our business andor magnify any negative impact of the above referenced factors on our business customers and results of operations increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk our liquidity competitive position business results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates fluctuations significant or otherwise in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors these market risks may adversely affect among other things the value of our securities trading assets and other financial instruments the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets the value of assets under management aum fee income relating to aum customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives the volume of client activity in our trading operations investment banking fees the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing for example the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates if the federal reserve or a nonus central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected which could adversely impact the value of such assets changes to fiscal policy including expansion of us federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance could also affect market interest rates in addition although some interest rates have begun to rise and elevated inflation could lead to further increases the continued low interest rate environment has had and could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations including on future revenue and earnings growth a flattening or inversion of the yield curve could also negatively impact our results of operations including revenue and earnings we use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa these types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses these changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours in these and other cases it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets to the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions 9 bank of america we may incur losses if asset values decline including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds we have a large portfolio of financial instruments including loans and loan commitments securities financing agreements assetbacked secured financings derivative assets and liabilities debt securities marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value that are subject to valuation and impairment assessments we determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance which for financial instruments measured at fair value requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements the fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity credit quality funding impact on certain derivatives and other transactionspecific factors where appropriate gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations unless we have effectively hedged our exposures increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt in addition increases in interest rates or changes in spreads may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as available for sale may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels these market moves also may adversely impact the value of debt securities we hold to meet regulatory liquidity requirements decreases in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain assets and therefore may adversely affect net interest income fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices the financial strength of counterparties with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets also will affect the fair value of these assets sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets which may make it difficult to sell hedge or value these assets the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our riskweighted assets rwa which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs values of aum also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for assetbased management and performance fees declines in values of aum can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets liquidity if we are unable to access the capital markets or continue to maintain deposits or our borrowing costs increase our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected liquidity is essential to our businesses we fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets we rely on certain secured funding sources such as repo markets which are typically shortterm and creditsensitive we also engage in asset securitization transactions including with the gses to fund consumer lending activities our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements including as a result of credit concerns for shortterm borrowing changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile prolonged federal government shutdowns or changes in regulations guidance or gse status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources additionally our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit slower customer payment rates restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds which could result from customer attrition for higher yields the desire for more conservative alternatives changes in customer behavior or our customers increased need for cash increased regulatory liquidity capital and margin requirements for our us or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or default by a significant market participant or third party including clearing agents custodians central banks or central counterparties ccps these factors also have the potential to increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our liquidity several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control such as general market volatility disruption shock or stress the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics federal reserve policy decisions including fluctuations in interest rates or federal reserve balance sheet composition negative views or loss of confidence about the corporation including short and longterm business prospects or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us the impact of these events whether within our control or not could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments unforeseen outflows of cash the need to draw on liquidity facilities the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls among other things the result of which could be increased costs a liquidity shortfall andor impact on our liquidity coverage ratio our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market conditions including changes in interest and currency exchange rates significant fluctuations in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads credit spreads reflect the published credit ratings or other assessments of credit risk and relative value by market participants of the corporation and represent the risk premiums that our funding providers demand in excess of a benchmark interest rate for example us treasury securities rates increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in marktomarket or credit valuation adjustment exposures changes in our credit spreads are marketdriven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness including changes in our credit ratings changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile we may also experience spread compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits due to increased marketplace rate competition additionally concentrations within our funding bank of america 10 profile such as maturities currencies or counterparties can reduce our funding efficiency reduction in our credit ratings could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings in addition credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions including otc derivatives credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and asset securitizations our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations and factors not under our control such as the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment including any continued macroeconomic stress caused by the pandemic or changes the rating agencies may make to the methodologies they use to determine our ratings rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any downgrades could occur a reduction in certain of our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity access to credit markets the related cost of funds our businesses and certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical if the shortterm credit ratings of our parent company or bank or brokerdealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels we may experience loss of access to shortterm funding sources such as repo financing andor incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements under the terms of certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements if our or our subsidiaries credit ratings are downgraded the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain as they depend upon numerous dynamic complex and interrelated factors and assumptions including whether any downgrade of a firms longterm credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its shortterm credit ratings and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers investors and counterparties bank of america corporation is a holding company is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries bank of america corporation as the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries we evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal regulatory contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another including the parent company which could result in adverse liquidity events the parent company depends on dividends distributions loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations including debt obligations any inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions additional restrictions on related party transactions increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts as well as lower earnings can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries also regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and to pay obligations could be materially adversely affected in the event of a resolution bank of america corporation our parent holding company is required to periodically submit a plan to the fdic and federal reserve describing its resolution strategy under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure in the current plan bank of america corporations preferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry strategy this strategy provides that only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the us bankruptcy code and contemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company bank of america corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries pursuant to these arrangements if bank of america corporations liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent bank of america corporation will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a whollyowned holding company subsidiary which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to return capital to shareholders including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the corporations common stock and meet our payment obligations if the fdic and federal reserve jointly determine that bank of america corporations resolution plan is not credible they could impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations we could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and could potentially result in the divestiture of certain assets or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries additionally under the financial reform act when a gsib such as bank of america corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct 11 bank of america an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations in 2013 the fdic issued a notice describing its preferred single point of entry strategy for resolving a gsib under this approach the fdic could replace bank of america corporation with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors the fdics single point of entry strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy to the extent that the corporation is resolved under the us bankruptcy code or the fdics orderly liquidation authority thirdparty creditors of the corporations subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims while security holders of bank of america corporation could face significant or complete losses credit economic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses a number of our products expose us to credit risk including loans letters of credit derivatives debt securities trading account assets and assets heldforsale deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our credit portfolios may be impacted by global and us macroeconomic and market conditions events and disruptions including declines in gdp consumer spending or property values asset price corrections increasing consumer and corporate leverage increases in corporate bond spreads rising or elevated unemployment levels rising or elevated inflation fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates as well as widespread health emergencies or pandemics extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change and domestic and global efforts to transition to a lowcarbon economy significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets which could impact the underlying credit quality of our borrowers counterparties and assets property value declines or asset price corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us and could decrease the value of the collateral we hold which could increase credit losses credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices including property or collateral values unrelated to macroeconomic stress simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit andor an increase in a borrowers leverage in a weakening economic environment could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our credit portfolios including consumer credit card home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses although macroeconomic conditions have improved during 2021 in comparison to 2020 the pandemic and the related impacts of inflationary conditions high input costs and supply chain disruptions unemployment or labor shortages and the expiration of pandemicrelated government benefits and programs could negatively impact the ability of consumer and commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations additionally the pandemic continues to impact the economy and certain sectors remain at risk eg travel and entertainment as well as commercial real estate office exposure to the extent the pandemic worsens as a result of new variants or otherwise resulting in restrictions on economic activity or other negative impacts on the macroeconomic environment our credit portfolio and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted we establish an allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in our relevant financial assets the process to determine the allowance for credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated this includes forecasting how borrowers or counterparties will perform in changing and unprecedented economic conditions such as predicting developments in public health and fiscal policy related to the pandemic the ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates there is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties which similarly could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates if the models estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties which are more sensitive due to the current macroeconomic environment including as a result of the uncertainty regarding the magnitude and duration of the pandemic prove inaccurate in predicting future events we may suffer unexpected losses in addition changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of expected credit losses however there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly and quickly in such an event we may increase our allowance which would reduce our earnings additionally to the extent that economic conditions worsen as a result of covid19 or otherwise impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral and credit losses are worse than expected we may increase our provision for credit losses which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively impact our financial condition our concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses results of operations and financial condition in the ordinary course of our business we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic financial public health or business developments for example concentrations of credit risk may reside in a particular industry geography product asset class counterparty or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry geographic location product or asset class or a failure or downgrade of or default by any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated bank of america 12 while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry predominantly comprised of brokerdealers commercial banks investment banks insurers mutual funds hedge funds central clearing counterparties and other institutional clients resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to these industries financial services institutions and other counterparties are interrelated because of trading funding clearing or other relationships as a result defaults by one or more counterparties or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally could lead to marketwide liquidity disruptions losses and defaults many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us which may occur as a result of events that impact the value of the collateral such as an asset price correction or fraud further disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral our commercial portfolios include exposures to certain industries including asset managers and funds real estate finance companies and capital goods economic weaknesses sustained elevated inflation adverse business conditions market disruptions rising interest or capitalization rates the collapse of speculative bubbles greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in cash flow and higher credit losses in either our consumer or commercial portfolios or cause us to write down the value of certain assets additionally we could experience continued and longterm negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that continue to be disproportionately impacted by covid19 or are permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences resulting from covid19 eg travel and entertainment as well as commercial real estate office exposure or other industry disruptions furthermore we have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate auto consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio the us has experienced a meaningful increase in property prices over the past year and a decrease in home price valuations or commercial real estate valuations in certain markets where we have large concentrations as well as more broadly within the us or globally could result in increased servicing expenses defaults delinquencies or credit losses in particular the impact of climate change such as rising average global temperatures and rising sea levels and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters such as droughts floods wildfires and hurricanes could negatively impact collateral the valuations of home prices or commercial real estate or our customers ability andor willingness to pay fees outstanding loans or afford new products this could also cause insurability risk andor increased insurance costs to customers we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations us states and municipalities unfavorable economic or political conditions disruptions to capital markets currency fluctuations changes in oil prices social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of our positions leading to increased concentrations which could increase the credit and market risk associated with our positions as well as increase our rwa we may be adversely affected if the us housing market weakens or home prices decline although the us has experienced a meaningful increase in home prices in 2021 we remain conscious of geographic markets where housing price growth has increased significantly that could be vulnerable to declines in future periods and may negatively impact the demand and underlying collateral for many of our products additionally our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market both of which may be adversely affected by rising interest rates any downturn in the condition of the us housing market similar to the 2008 financial crisis or otherwise could result in both significant writedowns of asset values in several asset classes notably mortgagebacked securities and exposure to monolines if the us housing market were to weaken the value of real estate could decline which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses we are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events such as a change in the credit rating of the corporation or one or more of its affiliates we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions and could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks in some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements we are also a member of various central counterparties ccps in part due to regulatory requirements for mandatory clearing of derivative transactions which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to ccps in the event that one or more members of the ccp defaults on its obligations we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default a ccp may modify in its discretion the margin we are required to post which could mean unexpected and increased exposure to the ccp as a clearing member we are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our clients for which we clear transactions which may not be covered by 13 bank of america available collateral additionally default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses geopolitical we are subject to numerous political economic market reputational operational compliance legal regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate we do business throughout the world including in emerging markets economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally resulting in among other things market volatility reduced market value and economic output our liquidity and credit risk could be adversely impacted by and our businesses and revenues derived from nonus jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from financial social or judicial instability changes in government leadership including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization andor confiscation of assets price controls high inflation natural disasters the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics capital controls currency redenomination risk from a country exiting the eu or otherwise currency fluctuations foreign exchange controls or movements caused by devaluation or depegging unfavorable political and diplomatic developments oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation these risks are especially elevated in emerging markets additionally continued tensions between the us and important trading partners particularly china may result in sanctions further tariff increases or other restrictive actions on crossborder trade investment and transfer of information technology that weigh on trade volumes raise costs for producers and adversely affect our businesses and revenues as well as our customers and counterparties a number of nonus jurisdictions in which we do business have been or may be negatively impacted by slowing growth or recessionary conditions market volatility andor political or civil unrest the ongoing pandemic had a severe negative impact on global gdp and despite significant progress in 2021 it appears that the global economy faces an uncertain and uneven recovery ahead while the us and numerous other countries have recovered to prepandemic levels of output many countries and areas within countries are recovering more slowly economic weakness may prove persistent in many countries and regions including certain regions of europe japan and numerous emerging markets moreover economic activity remains vulnerable to ongoing public health uncertainties with respect to the pandemic and a number of countries are still imposing significant restrictions on residents and businesses global supply chain disruptions labor shortages wage pressures and elevated inflation in many countries pose further challenges especially in the form of volatility in financial markets additionally foreign exchange rates against the us dollar are at risk of significant depreciation as the federal reserve raises interest rates we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors furthermore the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly in emerging markets are generally smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations including our us operations market and economic disruptions of all types may affect consumer confidence levels and spending corporate investment and job creation bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt economic growth rates and asset values among other factors any such unfavorable conditions or developments could adversely impact us as a result of the pandemic and fiscal policy responses to it including the increased purchase of government bonds and other financial assets by central banks government debt levels have increased significantly raising the risk of volatility significant valuation changes political tensions among eu members regarding fiscal policy or defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt which could expose us to substantial losses our nonus businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments securities exchanges and regulators central banks and other regulatory bodies in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our potential inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses and changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations in that market as well as our reputation in general in connection with the uks exit from the eu we are now subject to different laws and regulations which are expected to diverge further over time and are subject to the oversight of additional regulatory authorities as political and regulatory environments evolve further changes to the legal and regulatory framework under which our subsidiaries provide products and services in the uk and in the eu may result in additional compliance costs and have negative tax consequences or an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition to nonus legislation our international operations are also subject to us legal requirements which subjects us to operational and compliance costs and risks for example our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to bribery and corruption antimoney laundering and economic sanctions which can vary by jurisdiction the increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heighten financial crimes risk our ability to comply with these legal requirements depends on our ability to continually improve surveillance detection and reporting and analytic capabilities in the us debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns which have increased the possibility of us government defaults on its debt andor downgrades to its credit ratings and prolonged government shutdowns could weaken the us dollar cause market volatility negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition including our liquidity additionally changes in fiscal monetary or regulatory policy including as a result of labor shortages wage pressures supply chain disruptions and higher inflation could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations organizational structure and results of operations we are also subject to geopolitical risks including economic sanctions acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism actions taken by the us or other governments in response thereto statesponsored cyberattacks or campaigns civil unrest andor military conflicts which could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad and in the us for example escalating military tensions between russia and ukraine could result in regional instability and adversely impact bank of america 14 commodity and other financial markets as well as economic conditions especially in europe additionally this could magnify inflationary pressure resulting from the pandemic and extend any prolonged period of higher inflation business operations a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or business continuity plans or those of third parties or the financial services industry could disrupt our critical business operations and customer services result in additional risk exposures and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry infrastructure our operational and security systems infrastructure including our computer systems emerging technologies data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance we also rely on our employees and third parties including downstream service providers in our daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct including errors in judgment malice fraudulent activity andor engaging in violations of applicable policies laws rules or procedures malfeasance or a failure or breach of systems or infrastructure cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational losses regulatory risk and reputational harm the corporations and third parties inability to properly introduce deploy and manage changes to internal financial and governance processes existing products services and technology as well as new product innovations and technology could also result in additional operational and regulatory risk additionally our financial accounting data processing and transmission storage backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely may be ineffective or fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third partys control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services we could also experience prolonged computer and network outages resulting in disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services including abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms we may experience sudden increases in customer transaction volume or electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware or software failure of aging infrastructure and technology project implementation challenges which could result in prolonged operational outages climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as earthquakes wildfires tornadoes hurricanes and floods which could result in increased exposure to operational risks including outages additionally events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including civil unrest and terrorist acts could result in operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages we continue to execute our business continuity plans due to the pandemic and will likely continue to be subject to heightened operational risks to the extent that the pandemic persists we also continue to have greater reliance on remote access tools and technology and employees personal systems and increased data utilization and be increasingly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses remotely due to the increased number of employees who work from home and evolving customer preferences including increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses effective management of our business continuity depends on the security reliability and adequacy of such systems we also continue to be at risk of business disruptions due to illness and unavailability as the pandemic persists including from the emergence of new variants particularly if they are more transmissible andor severe regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training procedures backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties including their downstream service providers with whom we interact or upon whom we rely including systemic cyber events that result in system outages and unavailability of part or all of the internet cloud services andor the financial services industry infrastructure including critical banking activities our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with respect to our own systems furthermore to the extent that backup systems are available and utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up we regularly update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations globally this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or business continuity plans resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and customer services andor failure to identify and effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner could expose us to market abuse regulatory market privacy and liquidity risk and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk result in the disclosure andor misuse of information andor fraudulent activity and increase our operational and security systems and critical infrastructure costs our business is highly dependent on the security controls and efficacy of our infrastructure computer and data management systems as well as those of our customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties including their downstream service providers the financial services industry and financial data aggregators with whom we interact on whom we rely or who have access to our customers personal or account information our business relies on effective access management and the secure collection processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary personally identifiable and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to remotely access our network products and services our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our 15 bank of america network and control environments and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our employees customers regulators and third parties including providers of products and services are regularly the target of an increasing number of cyber threats and attacks and will continue to be cyber threats and techniques used in cyberattacks are pervasive sophisticated rapidly evolving difficult to prevent and include computer viruses malicious or destructive code such as ransomware social engineering including phishing vishing and smishing denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that could result in disruptions to our businesses and operations the loss of funds of the corporation andor its clients and the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction or theft of confidential proprietary and other information including intellectual property of ours our employees our customers or of third parties cybersecurity risks have also significantly increased in recent years in part due to the growing number and increasingly sophisticated activities of malicious cyber actors including organized crime groups hackers terrorist organizations extremist parties hostile foreign governments and statesponsored actors in some instances acting to promote political ends responding to policies andor actions of the us government we are also subject to cyberattacks by disgruntled employees activists and other third parties including those involved in corporate espionage our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of among other things the evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber threats our prominent size and scale our highprofile brand our geographic footprint and international presence and our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy the financial services industry including the corporation is particularly at risk because of the use of and reliance on digital banking and other digital services including mobile banking products such as mobile payments and other web and cloudbased products and applications and the development of additional remote connectivity solutions which increase cybersecurity risks and exposure acceptance and use of such digital banking products and services has substantially increased since the onset of the pandemic additionally the proliferation of thirdparty financial data aggregators and emerging technologies including our use of automation artificial intelligence ai and robotics increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure we continue to execute our business continuity plans due to the pandemic accordingly our risk and exposure to cyberattacks and security breaches remain magnified due to our continued reliance on remote access tools and technology resulting in increased reliance on virtualdigital interactions and a larger number of access points to our networks that must be secured this increased risk of unauthorized access to our networks results in greater amounts of information being available for access including from employees personal devices over which we do not have the same controls as we do when a larger employee population is working from our offices greater demand on our information technology infrastructure and security tools and processes will likely continue as the pandemic persists and may be experienced permanently we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry with whom we do business upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely other indirect risks relate to providers of products andor services financial counterparties financial data aggregators financial intermediaries such as clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses regulators providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power and retailers for whom we process transactions we are also at additional risk resulting from critical thirdparty information security and opensource software vulnerabilities additionally we have exposure to cyber threats as a result of our continuous transmission of sensitive information to and storage of such information by third parties including providers of products andor services and regulators the outsourcing of some of our business operations and system and customer account updates and conversions further any such event may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner similarly any failure cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises our systems or data could adversely impact third parties counterparties and the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other information or security vulnerability failure or breach that significantly exposes degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities or third parties or their downstream service providers could have a material impact on us our counterparties or other market participants and ultimately have an adverse impact on financial stability in the us andor globally this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis cyber threats and the techniques used in cyberattacks change rapidly despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate or detect cyberattacks or information or security breaches and implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address or mitigate such attacks or breaches even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data cyberattacks or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected it could take considerable additional time for us to determine the scope extent amount and type of information compromised at which time the impact on the corporation and measures to recover and restore to a businessasusual state may be difficult to assess as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional money and resources to modify or enhance our protective measures investigate and remediate any information security software or network vulnerabilities or incidents whether specific to us a third party the industry or businesses in general and develop our capabilities to respond and recover as a result increasing resources to develop and enhance our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems workstations intellectual property and proprietary information software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remains a critical priority although to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor bank of america 16 and mitigate the risks of cyber threats including the remediation of critical information security and

fraudulent or unauthorized transactions or cause prolonged computer and network outages resulting in material disruptions to our or our customers or other third parties network access or critical business operations and customer services in the us andor globally cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in significant lost revenue give rise to losses and claims brought by third parties litigation exposure government fines penalties or intervention and other negative consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyberattack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business andor result in the loss of confidence in our security measures additionally our failure to communicate cyber incidents appropriately to relevant parties could result in regulatory privacy operational and reputational risk although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate cyberattacks or other information or security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws in the us and abroad reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage securitizations loans owned by other entities and other losses we could incur as servicer could adversely impact our reputation servicing costs or results of operations we and our legacy companies service mortgage loans on behalf of thirdparty securitization vehicles and other investors if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice which could cause us to lose servicing income in addition we may have liability for any failure by us as a servicer or master servicer for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties if any such breach was found to have occurred it may harm our reputation increase our servicing costs result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations additionally with respect to foreclosures we may incur costs or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process we may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure changes in the structure of and relationship among the gses could adversely impact our business during 2021 we sold approximately 32 billion of loans to gses primarily freddie mac fhlmc fhlmc and fannie mae fnma are currently in conservatorship with their primary regulator the federal housing finance agency fhfa acting as conservator in september 2019 the treasury department published a proposal to recapitalize fhlmc and fnma and remove them from conservatorship as well as reduce their role in the marketplace consistent with this proposal in january 2021 the treasury department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of fhlmc and fnma and delineated the continued objective to remove the gses from conservatorship however we cannot predict the future prospects of the gses timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the gses in the housing market additionally if the gses were to take a reduced role in the marketplace including by limiting the mortgage products they offer we could be required to seek alternative funding sources retain additional loans on our balance sheet secure funding through the federal home loan bank system or securitize the loans through private label securitization accordingly uncertainty regarding their future and the mortgagebacked securities they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future any of these developments could adversely affect the value of our securities portfolios capital levels liquidity and results of operations our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us we seek to effectively and consistently identify measure monitor report and control the types of risk to which we are subject including strategic credit legal climate market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks while we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques including modeling and forecasting hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify all risks including emerging and unknown risks anticipate the timing of risks apply effective hedging strategies make correct assumptions manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently and develop risk management models to assess and control risk our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the corporation and manage risks associated with third parties including their downstream service providers including providers of products andor services to enable effective risk management and ensure that risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner uncertain economic conditions heightened 17 bank of america legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry the pace of technological changes accounting and market developments the failure of employees to comply with our policies and risk framework and the overall complexity of our operations among other developments may result in a heightened level of risk for us we have experienced increased operational reputational and compliance risk as a result of the need to rapidly implement multiple and varying pandemic relief programs such as ppp and the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states which have resulted and will continue to result in losses in addition to the continued execution of our business continuity plans due to the pandemic our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate manage control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses regulatory compliance and legal we are subject to comprehensive government legislation and regulations and certain settlements orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time we are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate including increasing and complex economic sanctions regimes these laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities including the products and services we offer reduce certain fees and rates or make our products and services more expensive for our clients additionally we are required to file various financial and nonfinancial regulatory reports to comply with laws and rules in the jurisdictions in which we operate we continue to adjust our business and operations legal entity structure and our policies processes procedures and controls including with regard to capital and liquidity management risk management and data management to comply with currently effective laws and regulations as well as final rulemaking guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities including the department of treasury including the internal revenue service irs federal reserve occ cfpb financial stability oversight council fdic department of labor sec and cftc in the us and foreign regulators and other government authorities further we could become subject to future legislation and regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed adopted or contemplated in the us or abroad including policies and rulemaking related to the financial reform act the pandemic emerging technologies and climate change the cumulative effect of all of the legislation and regulations on our business operations and profitability remains uncertain this uncertainty necessitates that in our business planning we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of prospective and proposed rules if these assumptions prove incorrect we could be subject to increased regulatory and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm in addition us and international regulatory initiatives may overlap and nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed us regulations which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs our regulators prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions and they have assumed an active oversight inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry regulatory focus is not limited to laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry but extends to other significant laws and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions including those related to data management and privacy antimoney laundering anticorruption and economic sanctions we are also subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and abroad including gdpr ccpa and cpra and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws regarding compliance with our privacy policies and the disclosure collection use sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information of certain parties such as our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties the violation of which could result in litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions the complexity and risk of compliance has been magnified by the collection of employee health information in response to the pandemic additionally we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the us and abroad which could result in additional costs of compliance litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions in particular there is increased complexity and uncertainty including potential suspension or prohibition regarding the standards used by the corporation for crossborder flows and transfers of personal data from the european economic area eea to the us and other jurisdictions outside of the eea resulting from a decision of the court of justice of the eu and guidance from the european data protection board additionally the european commission has published new standards of personal data transfer and china and the uk have commenced consultation efforts to establish standards for personal data transfers if crossborder personal data transfers are suspended or restricted or we are required to implement distinct processes for each jurisdictions standards this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses additional costs increased enforcement activity new contract negotiations with third parties andor modification of our crossborder data management as part of their enforcement authority our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to among other things conduct investigations and assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties or restitution and issue cease and desist orders and initiate injunctive actions the amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have in some instances been substantial and may increase in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions which could have significant consequences including reputational harm loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time the corporation and the conduct of its employees and representatives including conduct that could harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions additionally actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities responding to inquiries investigations lawsuits and proceedings is timeconsuming and expensive and can divert senior management attention from our business the bank of america 18 outcome of such proceedings which may last a number of years may be difficult to predict or estimate we are and may become subject to the terms of settlements orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities which impose or could impose significant operational and compliance costs on us as they typically require us to enhance our procedures and controls expand our risk and control functions within our lines of business invest in technology and hire significant numbers of additional risk control and compliance personnel moreover if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements orders or agreements to which we are subject or more generally fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities we could be required to enter into further settlements orders or agreements and pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to identify assess monitor and report on employees conduct applicable laws policies and procedures compliance risks will continue to exist particularly as we adapt to new and evolving laws rules and regulations additionally changing us fiscal monetary and regulatory policies and evolving priorities may result in ongoing regulatory uncertainties there is no guarantee that our risk management and compliance programs will be consistently executed to successfully manage compliance risk we also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk future legislative or regulatory actions and any required changes to our business or operations or those of third parties including their downstream providers upon whom we rely resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities require us to dispose of or curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that we hold require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect our businesses in addition investigations legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time that may result in fines regulatory sanctions penalties equitable relief and changes to our business practices as a result we are and will continue to be subject to heightened compliance and operating costs that could adversely affect our results of operations we are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action we continue to face significant legal risks in our business with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions the amount of damages penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be high this includes disputes with consumers customers and other counterparties financial institutions including us continue to be the subject of claims alleging anticompetitive conduct with respect to various products and markets including us antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages as disclosed in note 12  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we also face contractual indemnification and loanrepurchase claims arising from alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the sale of residential mortgages by legacy companies which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties in addition regulatory authorities have had a supervisory focus on enforcement including in connection with customer complaints alleged violations of law and customer harm for example us regulators and government agencies have pursued claims against financial institutions under the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act the false claims act fair lending laws and regulations including the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act antitrust laws and consumer protection laws and regulations including prohibitions on unfair deceptive andor abusive acts and practices under the consumer financial protection act and the federal trade commission act such claims may carry significant and in certain cases treble damages there is also an increased focus on compliance with global laws rules and regulations related to the collection use sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data additionally misconduct by the corporations employees and representatives including unethical fraudulent improper or illegal conduct or other unfair deceptive abusive or discriminatory business practices can result in litigation andor government investigations and enforcement actions and cause significant reputational harm there is also increased scrutiny of climate changerelated policies goals and disclosure which could result in litigation and regulatory investigations and actions the global environment of extensive investigations regulation regulatory compliance burdens litigation and regulatory enforcement combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment have affected and will likely continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks including the limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely continue to result in judgments orders settlements penalties and fines adverse to us further the corporations participation in implementing government relief measures related to the pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states may lead to additional such judgments orders settlements penalties and fines litigation and investigation costs substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition including liquidity and results of operations andor cause significant reputational harm to us us federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital total lossabsorbing capacity tlac longterm debt or liquidity requirements we are subject to us regulatory capital and liquidity rules these rules among other things establish minimum requirements to qualify as a wellcapitalized institution if any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fails to maintain its status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules the federal reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to wellcapitalized status for the duration of such an agreement the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our activities if we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement the federal reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities including 19 bank of america requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the bank holding company act of 1956 capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended it is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including tlac and longterm debt requirements change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers to the extent that increases occur in our scb gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease for example our gsib surcharge is expected to increase by 50 basis points to 30 percent on january 1 2024 as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may impact the level of our scb requiring us to hold additional capital additionally the federal reserve could reinstitute limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock as a result of the economic impact of the ongoing pandemic or otherwise impose such limitations in connection with other economic disruptions or events a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our rwa and our leverage exposure which may increase the basel committee on banking supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring rwa that have not yet been implemented in the us including a standardized approach for operational risk revised market risk requirements and constraints on the use of internal models as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches us banking regulators may update the us basel 3 rules to incorporate the basel committee revisions banks have experienced an increase in balance sheets increasing leverage exposures and causing leveragebased ratios to overtake riskbased capital ratios changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets increase borrowings issue additional equity or other securities cease or alter certain operations or hold highly liquid assets which may adversely affect our results of operations changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain if those assumptions estimates or judgments were misapplied we could be required to correct and restate priorperiod financial statements accounting standardsetters and those who interpret the accounting standards including the sec banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial statements in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively resulting in us revising priorperiod financial statements we may be adversely affected by changes in us and nonus tax laws and regulations it is possible that governmental authorities in the us andor other countries could further amend or repeal tax laws in a way that would materially adversely affect us including the possibility that aspects of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could be amended in the future any future change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our results of operations additionally us and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority this could result in additional tax liabilities and interest penalties the reduction of certain tax benefits andor the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded which could be material in addition we have uk net deferred tax assets dta which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors such as prolonged worsening of europes capital markets or changes in the ability of our uk subsidiaries to conduct business in the eu could lead our management to reassess andor change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our uk net dta reputation damage to our reputation could harm our businesses including our competitive position and business prospects our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and employees is impacted by our reputation harm to our reputation can arise from various sources including officer director andor employee activities such as fraud misconduct and unethical behavior such as employees sales practices security breaches litigation or regulatory matters and their outcomes compensation practices lending practices the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies including the reliability of our research and models and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions additionally our reputation may be harmed by failing to deliver the products and standards of service and quality expected by our customers clients and the community the failure to recognize and address customer complaints compliance failures the inability to manage technology change or maintain effective data management cyber incidents prolonged or repeated system outages internal and external fraud inadequacy of responsiveness to internal controls unintended disclosure of personal proprietary or confidential information conflicts of interest and breach of fiduciary obligations the handling of health emergencies or pandemics and the activities of our clients customers counterparties and third parties including providers of products andor services for example our reputation may be harmed in connection with our implementation of government programs to provide relief to address the economic impact of the pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states as well as how we handle employee matters related to the pandemic our reputation may also be negatively impacted by our esg practices and disclosures our businesses bank of america 20 and our customers including practices and disclosures related to climate change actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation also adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media by employees the media or otherwise whether or not factually correct may adversely impact our business prospects or financial results we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy fair lending activity udaap electronic funds transfers knowyourcustomer requirements data protection including the gdpr ccpa and cpra crossborder data movement and other matters principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices or that is inconsistent with one another if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession or in the possession of third parties including their downstream service providers or financial data aggregators is mishandled misused or mismanaged or if we do not timely or adequately address such information we may face regulatory reputational and operational risks which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues such as operational risks gives rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions legal risks and reputational harm which could among other consequences increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses other reforms to and replacement of ibors and certain other rates or indices may adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations there continues to be a major transition in progress in the global financial markets with respect to the replacement of ibors including the london interbank offered rate libor and certain other rates or indices that serve as benchmarks such benchmarks have been used extensively across the global financial markets and in our business in particular libor has historically been used in many of our products and contracts including derivatives consumer and commercial loans mortgages floatingrate notes and other adjustablerate products and financial instruments the aggregate notional amount of these products and contracts referencing libor or other ibors remains material to our business at the end of 2021 the global financial markets generally transitioned away from the use of all libor settings except for certain us dollar usd libor settings however there continue to be risks and challenges associated with the transition from ibors that may result in consequences that cannot be fully anticipated which expose us to various financial operational supervisory conduct and legal risks which we continue to monitor closely through a multiyear effort by the industry and regulators arrs have been identified andor developed and are being used to replace libor and other ibors however market and client adoption of arrs may vary across or within categories of contracts products and services resulting in market fragmentation decreased trading volumes and liquidity increased complexity and modeling and operational risks arrs have compositions and characteristics that differ from the benchmarks they replace in some cases have limited history and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace for example certain arrs are calculated on a compounded or weightedaverage basis and unlike ibors do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore typically require a spread adjustment there are important differences between the fallbacks triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets including within cash markets any mismatch between the adoption of arrs in loans securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented and as a result we may experience unanticipated market exposures changes resulting from transition to successor or alternative rates may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us amounts paid on securities we have issued amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into the value of such loans securities or derivative instruments the trading market for such products and contracts and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk there can be no assurance that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to ibors that have not already transitioned to arrs will successfully transition given the continuation of certain usd libor settings until june 30 2023 iborbased products and contracts ibor products linked to these libor settings will still have to be transitioned by such time although a significant majority of the aggregate notional amount of our iborbased products maturing after 2021 include or have been updated to include fallbacks to arrs the transitioning of certain ibor products that do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms will require additional efforts to modify their terms some outstanding ibor products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification to address such challenges in ibor products legislation has been adopted in various jurisdictions including the eu uk and new york state and federal legislation is pending in the us congress litigation disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation in particular if there is an overlap between laws in different jurisdictions some of our ibor products in particular liborbased products and contracts may contain language giving the calculation agent which may be us discretion to determine the successor rate including the arr andor the applicable spread adjustment to the existing benchmark we may face a risk of litigation disputes or other actions from clients counterparties customers investors or others based on various claims for example that the corporation incorrectly interpreted or enforced iborbased contract provisions failed to appropriately communicate the effect that the transition to arrs will have on 21 bank of america existing and future products treated affected parties unfairly or made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients or engaged in anticompetitive behavior or unlawfully manipulated markets or benchmarks we have launched and expect to continue to develop launch and support arrbased products and services there is no guarantee that liquidity in arrbased products will develop and it is possible that arrbased products including products using credit sensitive rates will perform differently to ibor products during times of economic stress adverse or volatile market conditions and across the credit and economic cycle which may impact the value return on and profitability of our arrbased assets new financial products linked to arrs may have additional legal financial tax operational market compliance reputational competitive or other risks to us our clients and other market participants in particular banking regulators in the us and globally have increased regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus of financial institution libor transition plans preparations and readiness including the corporations use of creditsensitive rates like the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index which could result in a regulatory action litigation andor the need to change the products offered by our businesses failure to meet industrywide ibor transition milestones and to cease issuance of ibor products by relevant cessation dates may subject to certain regulatory exceptions result in supervisory enforcement by applicable regulators increase our cost of and access to capital and other consequences the market transition may also alter our risk profile and risk management strategies including derivatives and hedging strategies modeling and analytics valuation tools product design and systems controls procedures and operational infrastructure this may prove challenging given the limited history of many of the proposed arrs and may increase the costs and risks related to potential regulatory compliance requirements or inquiries among other risks various ibor products transition to arrs at different times or in different manners with the result that we may face significant unexpected interest rate pricing or other exposures across business or product lines continuing reforms to market transition and other factors may adversely affect our business including the ability to serve customers and maintain market share financial condition or results of operations and could result in reputational harm to us we face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry we operate in a highly competitive environment and experience intense competition from local and global financial institutions as well as new entrants in both domestic and foreign markets in which we compete on the basis of a number of factors including customer service quality and range of products and services offered technology price fees reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits customer convenience and experience and relationships in relevant markets additionally the changing regulatory environment may create competitive disadvantages for us given geographydriven capital and liquidity requirements in addition emerging technologies and advances and the growth of ecommerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions made it easier for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed nontraditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internetbased financial solutions and services including electronic securities trading with low or no fees and commissions marketplace lending financial data aggregation and payment processing including realtime payment platforms further clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices fees commissions or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology andor reducing our market share or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us our inability to adapt our business strategies products and services could harm our business our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services delivered through multiple distribution channels our success depends on our and our thirdparty providers of products and services ability to adapt and develop our business strategies products services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences in particular the emergence of the pandemic has resulted in increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by the corporations businesses there is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services on more attractive terms including lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits and offer lower cost investment strategies which may impact our ability to grow revenue andor effectively compete additionally legislative and regulatory developments may affect the competitive landscape and impact the products and services that we can offer further we may be impacted by the growth of nondepository institutions that offer traditional banking products at higher rates or with low or no fees or otherwise offer alternative products this can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our feebased products and services either from a decrease in the volume of transactions or through a compression of spreads the widespread adoption and rapid evolution of new technologies including analytic capabilities selfservice digital trading platforms internet services distributed ledgers such as the blockchain system cryptocurrencies central bank digital currencies cbdcs and payment systems could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our online and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions as cbdc initiatives evolve and mature our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted including as a result of the introduction of new competitors to the payment ecosystem and increased volatility in deposits andor significant longterm reduction in deposits ie financial disintermediation also we may not be as timely or successful in developing or introducing new products and services integrating new products or services into our existing offerings responding managing or adapting to changes in consumer behavior preferences spending investing andor saving habits achieving market acceptance of our

thirdparty providers of products and services inability or resistance to timely innovate or adapt its operations products and services bank of america 22 to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could result in service disruptions and harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation we could suffer operational reputational and financial harm if our models and strategies fail to properly anticipate and manage risk we use models and strategies extensively to forecast losses project revenue measure and assess capital and liquidity requirements for credit market operational and strategic risks assist in capital planning and assess and control our operations and financial condition model risk management is a dedicated and independent risk function that defines model risk governance policy and guidelines for the corporation based on laws rules and regulations as well as internal requirements under our enterprise model risk policy model risk management is required to perform model oversight including independent validation before initial use ongoing monitoring reviews through outcomes analysis and benchmarking and periodic revalidation models are subject to inherent limitations due to the use of simplifying assumptions uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes and emerging risks from the use of applications that rely on ai our models and strategies may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity especially during severe market downturns or stress events which could limit their effectiveness and require timely recalibration the models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk our models may be adversely impacted as a result of human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee and review them at regular intervals and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes they contain erroneous data assumptions valuations formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected regardless of the steps we take to ensure effective controls governance monitoring and testing and implement new technology and automated processes we could

management could adversely impact our ability to develop our products and relationships with our customers increase regulatory risk and operational losses and damage our reputation our operations businesses and customers could be materially adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters which present shortterm and an increasing amount of longterm risks to us the physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters including floods wildfires hurricanes and tornados such disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations

an equivalent beforetax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense for purposes of this calculation we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate net interest yield which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds utilizes net interest income on an fte basis we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and taxexempt sources and is consistent with industry practices we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items eg debit valuation adjustment dva gains losses which result in nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of periodtoperiod operating performance we also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity a nongaap financial measure tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights msrs net of related deferred tax liabilities adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity in addition profitability relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives these ratios are as follows  return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity the tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets  return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity the tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total tangible assets  tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding we believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock the aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in tables 6 and 7 for more information on the reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measures see nongaap reconciliations on page 85 key performance indicators we present certain key financial and

recorded in global banking managing risk risk is inherent in all our business activities sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders if not managed well risk can result in financial loss regulatory sanctions and penalties and damage to our reputation each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies we take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement which are approved annually by the erc and the board the seven key types of risk faced by the corporation are strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational  strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors inappropriate business plans ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate  credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations  market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk  liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions  compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures  operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems people or external events  reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations the following sections address in more detail the specific procedures measures and analyses of the major categories of risk this discussion of managing risk focuses on the current risk framework that as part of its annual review process was approved by the erc and the board as set forth in our risk framework a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose and how we drive responsible growth it requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risktaking within our risk appetite sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success of the corporation and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the board our risk framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the corporation the risk framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the board through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities executive management assesses with board oversight the riskadjusted returns of each business management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans as well as the capital plan and risk appetite statement and recommends them annually to the board for approval our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve for more information regarding capital allocations see business segment operations on page 36 the corporations risk appetite indicates the amount of capital earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans consistent with applicable regulatory requirements our risk appetite provides a common set of measures for senior management and the board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing to take in alignment with our strategic and capital plans and ensure that the corporations risk profile remains aligned with our risk appetite our risk appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits our overall capacity to take risk is limited therefore we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities therefore we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner including during periods of stress our lines of business operate with risk limits which may include credit market andor operational limits as applicable that align with the corporations risk appetite executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits the board and its committees when appropriate oversee financial performance execution of the strategic and financial operating plans adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls for a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities see the discussion below and pages 49 through 82 for more information about the corporations risks related to the pandemic see item 1a risk factors on page 8 these bank of america 46 covid19 related risks are being managed within our risk framework and supporting risk management programs risk management governance the risk framework describes delegations of authority whereby the board and its committees may delegate authority to managementlevel committees or executive officers such delegations may authorize certain decisionmaking and approval functions which may be evidenced in documents such as committee charters job descriptions meeting minutes and resolutions the chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the board board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the corporation board of directors and board committees the board is composed of 16 directors all but one of whom are independent the board authorizes management to maintain an effective risk framework and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices in addition the board or its committees conduct inquiries of and receive reports from management on riskrelated matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of global risk management grm andor corporate audit to execute its responsibilities the board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprisewide oversight of our risk management activities through these activities the board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee executive management addressing key risks we face other board committees as described below provide additional oversight of specific risks each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the board on riskrelated matters within the committees responsibilities which is intended to collectively provide the board with integrated insight about our management of enterprisewide risks audit committee the audit committee oversees the qualifications performance and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm the performance of our corporate audit function the integrity of our consolidated financial statements our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and makes inquiries of management or the chief audit executive cae to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of corporate audit to execute its responsibilities the audit committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the new york stock exchange listing standards enterprise risk committee the erc has primary responsibility for oversight of the risk framework and key risks we face and of the corporations overall risk appetite it approves the risk framework and the risk appetite statement and further recommends these documents to the board for approval the erc oversees senior managements responsibilities for the identification measurement monitoring and control of key risks we face the erc

management committee or from one or more executive officers our primary management risk committee is the mrc subject to board oversight the mrc is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the corporation including an integrated evaluation of risk earnings capital and liquidity lines of defense we have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense front line units flus grm and corporate audit we also have control functions outside of flus and grm eg legal and global human resources the three 47 bank of america lines of defense are integrated into our managementlevel governance structure each of these functional roles is further described in this section executive officers executive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the board board committees or managementlevel committees executive officers in turn may further delegate responsibilities as appropriate to managementlevel committees management routines or individuals executive officers review our activities for consistency with our risk framework risk appetite and applicable strategic capital and financial operating plans as well as applicable policies and standards executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a daytoday basis consistent with the authority they have been delegated executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions front line units flus which include the lines of business as well as global technology and global operations are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities three organizational units that include flu activities and control function activities but are not part of grm are first the chief financial officer cfo group second the chief administrative officer cao group and third global strategy and enterprise platforms gsep global risk management grm is part of our control functions and operates as our independent risk management function grm led by the chief risk officer cro is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within flus and other control functions grm establishes written enterprise policies and procedures outlining how aggregate risks are identified measured monitored and controlled the cro has the stature authority and independence needed to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework and practices to guide the corporation in managing risk the cro has unrestricted access to the board and reports directly to both the erc and the ceo grm is organized into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical cro teams that cover a particular flu or control function these teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties corporate audit corporate audit and the cae maintain their independence from the flus grm and other control functions by reporting directly to the audit committee the cae administratively reports to the ceo corporate audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the corporation corporate audit includes credit review which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the corporations credit platform through examinations and monitoring risk management processes the risk framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic capital and financial planning processes and in daytoday business processes across the corporation thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner we employ an effective risk management process referred to as identify measure monitor and control as part of our daily activities identify  to be effectively managed risks must be proactively identified and well understood proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly risk identification is an ongoing process that incorporates input from flus and control functions it is designed to be forwardlooking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business measure  once a risk is identified it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic process including quantitative and qualitative components risk is measured at various levels including but not limited to risk type flu and legal entity and also on an aggregate basis this risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction concentrations portfolio quality and the overall economic environment senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios monitor  we monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite policies and standards we also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures through our monitoring we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner we also know when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions this includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management managementlevel committees or the board directly or through an appropriate committee control  we establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies standards procedures and processes the limits and controls can be adjusted by the board or management when conditions or risk tolerances warrant these limits may be absolute eg loan amount trading volume operational loss or relative eg percentage of loan book in higherrisk categories our flus are held accountable for performing within the established limits the formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process we instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications training policies procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities

appetite bank of america 48 corporationwide stress testing integral to our capital planning financial planning and strategic planning processes we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated these stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet earnings and capital and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices the intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on and offbalance sheet risks at the corporation and certain subsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency which provides confidence to management regulators and our investors contingency planning we have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse economic financial or market stress these contingency plans include our capital contingency plan and financial

restrictions on share repurchase programs and dividends during 2020 and the first half of 2021 49 bank of america in conjunction with its release of 2021 ccar supervisory stress test results the federal reserve announced those restrictions would end as of july 1 2021 for large banks including the corporation and large banks would be subject to the normal restrictions under the federal

holding company we are subject to regulatory capital rules including basel 3 issued by us banking regulators basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of calculating riskweighted assets rwa the standardized approach and the advanced approaches the standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type and the advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models the corporations depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the prompt corrective action pca framework the corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity bana are advanced approaches institutions under basel 3 and are required to report regulatory riskbased capital ratios and rwa under both the standardized and advanced approaches the approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the pca framework as of december 31 2021 the cet1 tier 1 capital and total capital ratios for the corporation were lower under the standardized approach minimum capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the corporation must meet riskbased capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 25 percent under the advanced approaches only an scb under the standardized approach only plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank gsib surcharge including a regulatory minimum requirement of 45 percent an scb of 25 percent and a gsib surcharge of 25 percent the corporations cet1 capital ratio must be a minimum of 95 percent under both the standardized and advanced approaches the corporation is required to calculate its gsib surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the basel committees assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance method 2 modifies the method 1 approach by among other factors including a measure of the corporations reliance on shortterm wholesale funding the corporations gsib surcharge which is higher under method 2 is expected to increase to 30 percent on january 1 2024 unless its surcharge calculated as of december 31 2022 is lower than 30 percent the current scb of 25 percent which remains effective from october 1 2021 through september 30 2022 could change based on results of the 2022 ccar capital plan and related supervisory stress tests to be submitted in the first half of 2022 the corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio slr of 30 percent plus a leverage buffer of 20 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 60 percent slr to be considered

liquidity risk management our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements including payments under longterm debt agreements commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions to achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base and seek to align liquidityrelated

i item 1a risk factors  coronavirus disease on page 8 and executive summary  recent developments  covid19 bank of america 54 pandemic on page 27 we define liquidity as readily available assets limited to cash and highquality liquid unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise we manage our liquidity position through lineofbusiness and alm activities as well as through our legal entity funding strategy on both a forward and current including intraday basis under both expected and stressed conditions we believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements maximizes access to funding sources minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events the board approves our liquidity risk policy and the financial contingency and recovery plan the erc establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels the mrc is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels the mrc reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity for more information see managing risk on page 46 under this governance framework we developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions diversifying funding sources considering our asset profile and legal entity structure and performing contingency planning nb holdings corporation the parent company which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries has an intercompany arrangement with our whollyowned holding company subsidiary nb holdings corporation nb holdings we have transferred and agreed to transfer additional parent company assets not required to satisfy anticipated nearterm expenditures to nb holdings the parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy under which only the parent company would be resolved under the us bankruptcy code in consideration for the transfer of assets nb holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets the aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers nb holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service nearterm cash needs these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy under which only the parent company would be resolved under the us bankruptcy code these arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to nb holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent global liquidity sources and other unencumbered assets we maintain liquidity available to the corporation including the parent company and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and highquality liquid unencumbered securities our liquidity buffer referred to as global liquidity sources gls is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries including holding company bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries even during stressed market conditions our cash is primarily on deposit with the federal reserve bank and to a lesser extent central banks outside of the us we limit the composition of highquality liquid unencumbered securities to us government securities us agency securities us agency mbs and other investmentgrade securities and a select group of nonus government securities we can obtain cash for these securities even in stressed conditions through repurchase agreements or outright sales we hold our gls in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses

including the parent nb holdings and other regulated entities parent company and nb holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at bana which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries and highquality liquid unencumbered securities liquidity held in other regulated entities comprised primarily of brokerdealer subsidiaries is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements our other regulated

percent and 122 percent our lcr fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity liquidity stress analysis we utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios the scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate marketwide and corporationspecific events including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios the scenarios are based on our historical experience experience of distressed and failed financial institutions regulatory guidance and both expected and unexpected future events the types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include but are not limited to upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances diminished access to secured financing markets potential deposit withdrawals increased draws on loan commitments liquidity facilities and letters of credit additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities changes in certain market factors including but not limited to credit rating downgrades could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results we consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity we also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses net stable funding ratio final rule on october 20 2020 us banking regulators finalized the net stable funding ratio nsfr a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a oneyear period the final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the lcr rule which focuses on shortterm liquidity risks the final rule was effective july 1 2021 and the corporation is in compliance the us nsfr applies to the corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions there have not been any significant impacts to the corporation diversified funding sources we fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products programs markets currencies and investor groups the primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control reduced funding costs wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries where regulations time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt we fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits which were 21 trillion and 18 trillion at december 31 2021 and 2020 deposits are primarily generated by our consumer banking gwim and global banking segments these deposits are diversified by clients product type and geography and the majority of our us deposits are insured by the fdic we consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable lowcost and consistent source of funding we believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings including credit card securitizations and securitizations with governmentsponsored enterprises gse the federal housing administration fha and privatelabel investors as well as fhlb loans our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions we believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing repurchase agreements are generally shortterm and often overnight disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing we manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations when appropriate for more information on secured financing agreements see note 10  securities financing agreements shortterm borrowings and restricted cash to the consolidated financial statements total longterm debt increased 172 billion to 2801 billion during 2021 primarily due to debt issuances partially offset by debt maturities redemptions and valuation adjustments we may from time to time purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions depending on market conditions liquidity and other factors our other regulated bank of america 56 entities may also make markets in our

through 2026 respectively and 970 billion thereafter we issue longterm unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve costefficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile while the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the corporation we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter we may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes certain of which qualify as tlaceligible debt during 2021 we issued 71 billion of structured notes which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities indices currencies or commodities we typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives andor investments in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective the cost is similar to our other unsecured longterm debt we could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances which we consider for liquidity planning purposes we believe however that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment require additional collateral support

intended to profit from directional or relative value changes we execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the otc market with large multinational financial institutions including brokerdealers and to a lesser degree with a variety of other investors because these transactions are executed in the otc market we are subject to settlement risk we are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts in order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets including our purchased credit default protection in most cases credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis therefore events such as a credit downgrade depending on the ultimate rating level or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty where applicable andor

management market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations primarily within our global markets segment we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation eg our alm activities in the event of market stress these risks could have a material impact on our results for more information see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 79 we have been affected and may continue to be affected by market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020 for more information see part 1 item 1a risk factors  coronavirus disease on page 8 our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities historical cost however these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our alm activities we have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income trading positions are subject to various changes in marketbased risk factors the majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate foreign exchange credit equity and commodities markets in addition the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility we seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments the key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the trading risk management section global risk management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed these responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy developing and maintaining quantitative risk models calculating aggregated risk measures establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements market risks that impact businesses outside of global markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports given that models are used across the corporation model risk impacts all risk types including credit market and operational risks the enterprise model risk policy defines model risk standards consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice all models including risk management valuation and regulatory capital models must meet certain validation criteria including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking the enterprise model risk committee emrc a subcommittee of the mrc oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the corporation interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates these instruments include but are not limited to loans debt securities certain tradingrelated assets and liabilities deposits borrowings and derivatives hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in nonus subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated loans and securities future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions foreign currencydenominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or nonus interest rates hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options currency swaps futures forwards and foreign currencydenominated debt and deposits mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgagerelated instruments the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates mortgage rates agency debt ratings default market liquidity government participation and interest rate volatility our exposure to these instruments takes several forms for example we trade and engage in marketmaking activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans passthrough certificates commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral in addition we originate a variety of mbs which involves the accumulation of mortgagerelated loans in anticipation of eventual securitization and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio we also record msrs as part of our mortgage origination activities hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options swaps futures and forwards as well as securities including mbs and us treasury securities for more information see mortgage banking risk management on page 80 equity market risk equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equitylinked instruments instruments that would lead to this exposure include but are not limited to the following common stock exchangetraded funds american depositary receipts convertible bonds listed equity options puts and calls otc equity options equity total return swaps equity index futures and other equity derivative products hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options futures swaps convertible bonds and cash positions commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum natural gas power and metals markets these instruments consist primarily of futures forwards swaps and options hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include 75 bank of america options futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product as well as cash positions issuer credit risk issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads by credit migration or by defaults hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds cds and other credit fixedincome instruments market liquidity risk market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and in certain cases may even cease this exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results this impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments we utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in trading risk management trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the corporation these measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves such as var and stress testing periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations additionally risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments var is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors including the effects of portfolio diversification a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses var represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period based on a specified holding period confidence level and window of historical data we use one var model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a threeyear window of historical data our primary var statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on average 99 out of 100 trading days within any var model there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company the accuracy of a var model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio a var model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available for positions with insufficient historical data for the var calculation the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position this analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience var may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results in particular the historical data used for the var calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced in order for the var model to reflect current market conditions we update the historical data underlying our var model on a weekly basis or more frequently during periods of market stress and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model a minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in var these risks are reviewed as part of our icaap for more information regarding icaap see capital management on page 49 global risk management continually reviews evaluates and enhances our var model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio changes to the var model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees trading limits on quantitative risk measures including var are independently set by global markets risk management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity volatility and strategic business priorities trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors all trading limits are approved at least annually approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the corporations risk appetite statement these risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the erc and the board in periods of market stress global markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses key risk positions and any limit excesses as a result of this process the businesses may selectively reduce risk table 43 presents the total marketbased portfolio var which is the combination of the total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio and the fair value option portfolio covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities both on and offbalance sheet that meet a defined set of specifications these specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a shortterm horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a twoway market positions in less liquid markets or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions typically do not qualify as covered positions foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval bank of america 76 in addition table 43 presents our fair value option portfolio which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option and their corresponding hedges additionally market risk var for trading activities as presented in table 43 differs from var used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used the holding period for var used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days while for the market risk var presented below it is one day both measures utilize the same process and methodology the total marketbased portfolio var results in table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments excluding credit valuation adjustment cva dva and related hedges the majority of this portfolio is within the global markets segment table 43 presents yearend average high and low daily trading var for 2021 and 2020 using a 99 percent confidence level the amounts disclosed in table 43 and table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the basel 3 capital calculations foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval the annual average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio var decreased for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in diversification across asset classes table 43 market risk var for trading activities 2021 2020 dollars in millions year end average high 1 low 1 year end average high 1 low 1 foreign

accuracy of the var methodology is evaluated by backtesting which compares the daily var results utilizing a oneday holding period against a comparable subset of trading revenue a backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the var for the corresponding day these excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the var methodology accurately represents those losses we expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of var to be in line with the confidence level of the var statistic being tested for example with a 99 percent confidence level we expect one trading loss in excess of var every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of var over the course of a year the number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the var calculation the trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the var component of the regulatory capital calculation this revenue differs from total tradingrelated revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in var some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading revenues we conduct daily backtesting on the var results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the var results for key legal entities regions and risk factors these results are reported to senior market risk management senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests during 2021 there were two days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio var utilizing a oneday holding period total tradingrelated revenue total tradingrelated revenue excluding brokerage fees and cva dva and funding valuation adjustment gains losses represents the total amount earned from trading positions including marketbased net interest income which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets for more information on fair value see note 20  fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements tradingrelated revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand also tradingrelated revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions the level of risk assumed and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the everchanging market environment significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed the following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of tradingrelated revenue for 2021 and 2020 during 2021 positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days of which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over 25 million and the largest loss was 45 million this compares to 2020 where positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days of which 87 percent were daily trading gains of over 25 million and the largest loss was 90 million bank of america 78 trading portfolio stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis this analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements a set of scenarios categorized as either historical or hypothetical are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses these scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate var historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress generally a multiweek period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information in addition new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio the stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprisewide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework the macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprisewide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning for more information see managing risk on page 46 interest rate risk management for the banking book the following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates clientfacing activities primarily lending and deposittaking create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet we prepare forwardlooking forecasts of net interest income the baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth alm positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the marketbased forward curve we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions the net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends market conditions and business strategies thus we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes the interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing changes in funding mix product repricing maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital table 45 presents the spot and 12month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at december 31 2021 and 2020 table 45 forward rates december 31 2021 federal funds threemonth libor 10year swap spot rates 025  021  158  12month forward rates 100 107 184 december 31 2020

instantaneous parallel and nonparallel shocks to the marketbased forward curve periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar rates are floored at zero during 2021 the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to uprate and downrate scenarios was primarily due to alm activity and an increase in longend rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as afs may adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel 3 capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income for more information on basel 3 see capital management  regulatory capital on page 50 table 46 estimated banking book net interest income sensitivity to curve changes short rate bps

assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table 46 assumes no change in 79 bank of america deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table 46 the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is insignificant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note 3  derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage banking risk management we originate fund and service mortgage loans which subject us to credit liquidity and interest rate risks among others we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments irlcs and the related residential first mortgage lhfs between the date of the irlc and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market an increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments conversely when there is an increase in interest rates the value of the msrs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative

information on basel 3 calculations see capital management on page 49 flus and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses including their compliance and operational risk flus and control functions are required to understand their business processes and related risks and controls including thirdparty dependencies and the related regulatory requirements and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment in order to actively monitor and assess the performance of their processes and controls they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses flus and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic capital and financial planning objectives finally flus and control functions are responsible for the proactive identification management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the corporation collectively these efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption bank of america 80 global compliance and operational risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk monitor business activities and processes and evaluate flus and control functions for adherence to applicable laws rules and regulations including identifying issues and risks determining and developing tests to be conducted by the enterprise independent testing unit and reporting on the state of the control environment enterprise independent testing an independent testing function within grm works with global compliance and operational risk the flus and control functions in the identification of testing needs and test design and is accountable for test execution reporting and analysis of results corporate audit provides an independent assessment and validation through testing of key compliance and operational risk processes and controls across the corporation the corporations global compliance enterprise policy and operational risk management  enterprise policy set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational risk information to executive management as well as the board or appropriate boardlevel committees and reflect global compliance and operational risks responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of the corporations compliance and operational risk management activities the board provides oversight of compliance risk through its audit committee and the erc and operational risk through its erc a key operational risk facing the corporation is information security which includes cybersecurity cybersecurity risk represents among other things exposure to failures or interruptions of service or breaches of security including as a result of malicious technological attacks that impact the confidentiality availability or integrity of our or third parties operations systems or data the corporation seeks to mitigate information security risk and associated reputational and compliance risk by employing a multilayered and intelligenceled global information security program which is focused on preparing for preventing detecting mitigating responding to and recovering from cyber threats and incidents and ensuring the corporations processes operate effectively and mitigate the aforementioned risks the global information security program is supported by three lines of defense the global information security team within the first line of defense is responsible for the daytoday management of the global information security program which includes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the corporations information systems and data conducting vulnerability and thirdparty information security assessments information security event management eg responding to ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks evaluation of external cyber intelligence supporting industry cybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies as well as developing employee training to support adherence to the corporations policies and procedures as the second line of defense global compliance and operational risk independently assesses monitors and tests information security risk across the corporation as well as the effectiveness of the global information security program corporate audit serves as the third line of defense conducting additional independent review and validation of the first line processes and functions through established governance structures we have processes to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight of information security risk these routines enable our three lines of defense and management to debate information security risks and monitor control performance to allow for further escalation to executive management management and boardlevel committees or to the board as appropriate the board is actively engaged in the oversight of bank of americas global information security program primarily through the erc reputational risk management reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations reputational risk may result from many of the corporations activities including those related to the management of our strategic operational compliance and credit risks the corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls embedded throughout its business and risk management processes we proactively monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner if reputational risk events occur we focus on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the corporations reputation the corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks the corporations organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to management and the erc which provides primary oversight of reputational risk in addition each flu has a committee which includes representatives from legal and risk that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk including approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks climate risk management climaterelated risks are divided into two major categories 1 risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy which may entail extensive policy legal technology and market changes and 2 risks related to the physical impacts of climate change driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods as well as chronic longerterm shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sealevel rise these changes and events can have broad impacts on operations supply chains distribution networks customers and markets and are otherwise referred to respectively as transition risk and physical risk these risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types the impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational andor litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral in addition it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people 81 bank of america effective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance clearly defined roles and responsibilities and welldeveloped processes to identify measure monitor and control risks we continue to build out and enhance our climate risk management capabilities as climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk framework and risk management programs established for strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks our environmental and social risk policy framework esrpf aligns with our risk framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to environmental and social risks inclusive of climate risk our governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices and strategies by the board supported by its corporate governance esg and sustainability committee and erc as well as the mrc and the global esg committee both of which are managementlevel committees comprised of senior leaders across every major flu and control function our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the global climate risk executive who reports to the cro the global climate risk executive chairs the climate risk steering council which meets monthly and shapes our approach to managing climaterelated risks in line with our risk framework as outlined in our esrpf we are focused on supporting and financing areas critical to the transition to a lowcarbon economy accordingly we have a goal publicly announced in early 2021 to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities operations and supply chain before 2050 net zero goal more broadly achieving this goal will require technological advances clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors public policies and better emissions data reporting as well as ongoing strong and active engagement with clients suppliers investors government officials and other stakeholders our progress towards achieving our net zero goal is based on establishing the baseline for emissions associated with our financing activities often referred to as financed emissions currently we are using the partnership for carbon accounting financials methodology to assess our financed emissions additionally given the urgency required to address climate change we helped to launch the net zero banking alliance nzba in april 2021 which outlines guidelines for banks to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions including requirements for setting interim targets as a member of nzba the corporation and more than 100 other financial institution members representing more than 40 percent of the worlds banking assets have committed to set emission reduction targets for 2030 we plan to begin disclosure of financed emissions by 2023 and set 2030 targets for the significant majority of emissions in our portfolio in 2021 we also announced a goal to deploy 1 trillion by 2030 to accelerate the transition to a lowcarbon sustainable economy by providing lending capital raising advisory and investment services and by developing other clientdriven financial solutions this commitment anchors a broader 15 trillion sustainable finance goal to support both environmental transition and social inclusive development which spans business activities across the globe these goals are intended to help drive business opportunities and enhance risk management related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy for more

the contents of the corporations website and 2021 annual report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10k the foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2021 annual report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management including environmental transition considerations include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the corporations control actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of these forwardlooking statements complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles as described in note 1  summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements are essential in understanding the mda many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments the more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates in many cases there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models where alternatives exist we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables the value of our lending portfolio and marketsensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date often significantly due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant negative effect on future operating results these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs bank of america 82 allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting principles and note 5  outstanding loans and leases and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements the determination of allowance for credit losses is based on numerous estimates and assumptions which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated a critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our quantitative models as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its expected credit losses ecl calculation which have included a baseline scenario which is derived from consensus estimates downside scenarios a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario beginning in 2020 the scenarios incorporated the potential impacts of the pandemic and beginning in the second quarter in 2021 an additional scenario was added to account for inflationary risk and higher interest rates generally as the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate the allowance for credit losses will change in a similar direction there are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including but not limited to us gross domestic product gdp and unemployment rates as of december 31 2020 the weighted macroeconomic outlook for us average unemployment rate was forecasted at 66 percent 55 percent and 50 percent in the fourth quarters of 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for us gdp was forecasted to grow at 25 percent 24 percent and 21 percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarters of 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively as of december 31 2021 the latest consensus estimates for the us average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 44 percent and us gdp was forecasted to grow 52 percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarter of 2021 both of which were meaningfully better than our macroeconomic outlook as of december 31 2020 and were factored into our december 31 2021 allowance for credit losses estimate in addition as of december 31 2021 the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the us average unemployment rate was forecasted at 52 percent and 47 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023 and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for us gdp was forecasted to grow 21 percent and 19 percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023 in addition to the above judgments and estimates the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio such as increases or decreases in credit andor internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices which is a primary driver of ltvs in our consumer real estate portfolio all of which have some degree of uncertainty as the macroeconomic outlook improved in 2021 along with improvements in asset quality the allowance for credit losses decreased to 138 billion from 207 billion at december 31 2020 to provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses the corporation compared the december 31 2021 modeled ecl from the baseline scenario and our downside scenario relative to the baseline scenario the downside scenario assumed a peak us unemployment rate of approximately three percentage points higher than the consensus outlook a decline in us gdp followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of 14 percent at the trough this sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately 5 billion while the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ecls it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook importantly the analysis does not incorporate a variety of factors including qualitative reserves and the weighting of alternate scenarios which could have offsetting effects on the estimate considering the variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends in addition to other qualitative factors the corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at december 31 2021 is appropriate fair value of financial instruments under applicable accounting standards we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value we classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and msrs based on the threelevel fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards the fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments such as market liquidity and credit quality where appropriate valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs where market data is available the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity in periods of extreme volatility lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process in keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities we have in place various processes and controls that include a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss 83 bank of america reporting for all traded products primarily through validation controls we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both marketobservable and internallymodeled values andor valuation inputs our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker andor pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling for example broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable these processes and controls are performed independently of the business for more information see note 20  fair value measurements and note 21  fair value option to the consolidated financial statements level 3 assets and liabilities financial assets and liabilities and msrs where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards the fair value of these level 3 financial assets and liabilities and msrs is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as level 1 or 2 therefore gains or losses associated with level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy the level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital we conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis transfers into or out of level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable respectively in the current marketplace for more information on transfers into and out of level 3 during 2021 2020 and 2019 see note 20  fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets accrued income taxes reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date we currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction net deferred tax assets reported as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements nol and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods we consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized consistent with the applicable accounting guidance we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes andor net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities these revisions of our estimates which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters may be material to our operating results for any given period see note 19  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for a table of significant tax attributes and

intangible assets are discussed in note 1  summary of significant accounting principles and note 7  goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june 30 2021 by using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its respective carrying value factors considered in the qualitative assessment included among other things macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity and reportingunit specific considerations based on our qualitative assessment we have concluded that it was not more likely than not that the reporting units

required to be communicated to the audit committee and that i relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and ii involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matters below providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate allowance for loan and lease losses  commercial and consumer card loans as described in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements the allowance for loan and lease losses represents managements estimate of the expected credit losses in the corporations loan and lease portfolio excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair bank of america 88 value option as of december 31 2021 the allowance for loan and lease losses was 124 billion on total loans and leases of 9713 billion which excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option for commercial and consumer card loans the expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan in its loss forecasting framework the corporation incorporates forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets these macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses these variables include but are not limited to unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads the scenarios that are chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal as well as thirdparty economists and industry trends also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in the corporations assessment may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions factors that the corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures business conditions the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements among others further the corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data the principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a critical audit matter are i the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios related weightings to each scenario and certain qualitative reserves which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained and ii the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements these procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses including controls over the evaluation and approval of models forecast scenarios and related weightings and qualitative reserves these procedures also included among others testing managements process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses including i evaluating the appropriateness of the loss forecast models and methodology ii evaluating the reasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables iii evaluating the reasonableness of managements development selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models iv testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate and v evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses the procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast models the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios and related weightings and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves valuation of certain level 3 financial instruments as described in notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements the corporation carries certain financial instruments at fair value which includes 107 billion of assets and 69 billion of liabilities classified as level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a recurring basis and 23 billion of assets classified as level 3 fair value measurements that are valued on a nonrecurring basis for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation the corporation determines the fair value of level 3 financial instruments using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement unobservable inputs such as volatility or price may be determined using quantitativebased extrapolations or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information the principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment and estimation used by management to determine the fair value of these financial instruments which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained including the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements these procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments including controls related to valuation models significant unobservable inputs and data these procedures also included among others the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments and comparison of managements estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and evaluating the reasonableness of managements significant unobservable inputs charlotte north carolina february 22 2022 we have served as the corporations

america corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 summary of significant accounting principles bank of america corporation a bank holding company and a financial holding company provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the us and in certain international markets the term the corporation as used herein may refer to bank of america corporation individually bank of america corporation and its subsidiaries or certain of bank of america corporations subsidiaries or affiliates principles of consolidation and basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the corporation and its majorityowned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities vies where the corporation is the primary beneficiary intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition and for vies from the dates that the corporation became the primary beneficiary assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the consolidated financial statements the corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting these investments which include the corporations interests in affordable housing and renewable energy partnerships are recorded in other assets equity method investments are subject to impairment testing and the corporations proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions certain priorperiod amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation significant accounting principles cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand cash items in the process of collection cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations and amounts due from correspondent banks the federal reserve bank and certain nonus central banks certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements securities financing agreements securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions generally these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest in instances where the interest is negative the corporations policy is to present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense for securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option the changes in the fair value of these securities financing agreements are recorded in market making and similar activities in the consolidated statement of income the corporations policy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate securities financing agreements do not create material credit risk due to these collateral provisions therefore an allowance for loan losses is not necessary in transactions where the corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral it recognizes an asset on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value representing the securities received and a liability representing the obligation to return those securities collateral the corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge at december 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of this collateral was 8548 billion and 8124 billion of which 7827 billion and 7585 billion were sold or repledged the primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell the corporation also pledges companyowned securities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements securities loaned public and trust deposits us treasury tax and loan notes and shortterm borrowings this collateral which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions is parenthetically disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet in certain cases the corporation has transferred assets to consolidated vies where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the vies these assets are included on the consolidated balance sheet in assets of consolidated vies in addition the corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty generally the corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash us treasury securities and other marketable securities based on provisions contained in master netting agreements the corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets the corporation also pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities trading instruments financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities if these market prices are not available fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation realized gains and losses are recorded on a tradedate basis realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in market making and similar activities derivatives and hedging activities derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers for trading or to support risk management activities derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are bank of america 94 not designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships referred to as other risk management activities the corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives derivatives utilized by the corporation include swaps futures and forward settlement contracts and option contracts all derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis for exchangetraded contracts fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable marketbased pricing parameters similar to those applied to overthecounter otc derivatives for nonexchange traded contracts fair value is based on dealer quotes pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk these values also take into account the corporations own credit standing trading derivatives and other risk management activities derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities derivatives used for other risk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the consolidated statement of income to the extent effective the changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights msrs interest rate lock commitments irlcs and firstlien mortgage loans heldforsale lhfs that are originated by the corporation are recorded in other income changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included in market making and similar activities credit derivatives are also used by the corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures the changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in market making and similar activities and other income derivatives used for hedge accounting purposes accounting hedges for accounting hedges the corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges additionally the corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction the corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the corporations assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or liability for interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations the corporation also uses cash flow hedges to hedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item net investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated oci the remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market making and similar activities securities debt securities are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at their trade date their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired debt securities purchased for use in the corporations trading activities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in market making and similar activities substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the corporations asset and liability management alm activities and are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as heldtomaturity htm debt securities debt securities carried at fair value are either availableforsale afs securities with unrealized gains and losses netoftax included in accumulated oci or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in market making and similar activities htm debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost the corporation evaluates each afs security where the value has declined below amortized cost if the corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security it is written down to fair value through earnings for afs debt securities the corporation intends to hold the corporation evaluates the debt securities for expected credit losses ecl except for debt securities that are 95 bank of america guaranteed by the us treasury us government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where the corporation applies a zero credit loss assumption for the remaining afs debt securities the corporation considers qualitative parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral if an afs debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters a discounted cash flow analysis is used by the corporation to determine if a portion of the unrealized loss is a result of an expected credit loss the corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to its current estimate of excepted credit losses cash flows expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant information available such as remaining payment terms prepayment speeds the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral if any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors that amount is recognized in accumulated oci in certain instances the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value in which case the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset the corporation separately evaluates its htm debt securities for any credit losses of which substantially all qualify for the zero loss assumption for the remaining securities the corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses interest on debt securities including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is included in interest income premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment if any plus or minus qualifying observable price changes these securities are reported in other assets loans and leases loans with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income chargeoffs unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans and for purchased loans net of any unamortized premiums or discounts loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans unearned income discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology the corporation elects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with interest reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income under applicable accounting guidance for reporting purposes the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and within each portfolio segment by class of financing receivables a portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses and a class of financing receivables is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute risk characteristics and methods for assessing risk the corporations three portfolio segments are consumer real estate credit card and other consumer and commercial the classes within the consumer real estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity the classes within the credit card and other consumer portfolio segment are credit card directindirect consumer and other consumer the classes within the commercial portfolio segment are us commercial nonus commercial commercial real estate commercial lease financing and us small business commercial leases the corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lessor arrangements direct financing leases and salestype leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income which is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method operating lease income is recognized on a straightline basis the corporations lease arrangements generally do not contain nonlease components allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments and represents managements estimate of the ecl in the corporations loan and lease portfolio excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option the ecl on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contraasset to loans and leases on the consolidated balance sheet the ecl for unfunded lending commitments including home equity lines of credit helocs standby letters of credit sblcs and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the consolidated balance sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities the provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the consolidated statement of income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the current estimate of ecl for loans and leases the ecl is typically estimated using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the loan the life of the loan for closedended products is based on the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected prepayments the contractual maturity includes any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower for openended products eg lines of credit the ecl is determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are unconditionally cancellable eg credit cards in which case the corporation does not record any allowance in its loss forecasting framework the corporation incorporates forwardlooking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets these macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses these variables include but are not limited to unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels and corporate bond spreads as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages bank of america 96 multiple scenarios the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends the estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off ie negative allowance if a loan has been charged off the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance instead expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the chargeoff the allowance for loan and lease losses for troubled debt restructurings tdr is measured based on the present value of projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or in cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral dependent at the loans collateral value or its observable market price if available the measurement of ecl for the renegotiated consumer credit card tdr portfolio is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average tdr portfolio contractual interest rate excluding promotionally priced loans in effect prior to restructuring projected cash flows for tdrs use the same economic outlook as discussed above for purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in the corporations assessment may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions described above for example factors that the corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures business conditions the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements among others further the corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data with the exception of the corporations credit card portfolio the corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest income for these loans at that time for credit card loans the corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses upon chargeoff of a credit card loan the corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line item where it was originally recorded the corporation has identified the following three portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods consumer real estate to estimate ecl for consumer loans secured by residential real estate the corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the life of the existing portfolio after factoring in estimated prepayments using quantitative modeling methodologies the attributes that are most significant in estimating the corporations ecl include refreshed loantovalue ltv or in the case of a subordinated lien refreshed combined ltv cltv borrower credit score months since origination and geography all of which are further broken down by present collection status whether the loan is current delinquent in default or in bankruptcy the estimates are based on the corporations historical experience with the loan portfolio adjusted to reflect the economic outlook the outlook on the unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates the corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the federal housing administration fha and longterm standby loans as these loans are fully insured the corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ecl associated with the undrawn portion of the corporations helocs which can only be canceled by the corporation if certain criteria are met the ecl associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of default for loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateraldependent tdrs the corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell the fair value of the collateral securing these loans is generally determined using an automated valuation model avm that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the metropolitan statistical area in which the property being valued is located in the event that an avm value is not available the corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations the corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral while there is inherent imprecision in these valuations the corporation believes that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate for loans that are more than 180 days past due and collateraldependent tdrs with the exception of the corporations fully insured portfolio the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off if the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial chargeoff the corporation will record an additional chargeoff however if the value increases in periods subsequent to the chargeoff the corporation will adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative chargeoff amount credit cards and other consumer credit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined maturity date the estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected future payments eg borrowers making full payments minimum payments or somewhere in between that it will take for a receivable balance to pay off the ecl on the future payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower through time using key borrowerspecific factors and the economic outlook described above the corporation applies all expected payments in accordance with the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ie paying down the highest interest rate bucket first then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance until it is brought to zero or an expected chargeoff amount unemployment rate outlook borrower credit score delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model 97 bank of america future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ecl as they are unconditionally cancellable the ecl for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also determined using quantitative methods supplemented with qualitative analysis the quantitative model estimates ecl giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics such as delinquency status borrower credit score ltv ratio underlying collateral type and collateral value commercial the ecl on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate credit losses over the loans contractual life at an individual loan level the models use the contractual terms to forecast future principal cash flows while also considering expected prepayments for openended commitments such as revolving lines of credit changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrowers draw and payment behavior over the remaining life of the commitment for loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source of repayment the loss forecasting models consider key loan and customer attributes such as ltv ratio net operating income and debt service coverage and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region the outlook on the unemployment rate gross domestic product and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such as rent levels and vacancy rates which impact the ecl estimate for all other commercial loans and leases the loss forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrowers current credit risk rating industry sector size of the exposure and the geographic market the severity of loss is determined based on the type of collateral securing the exposure the size of the exposure the borrowers industry sector any guarantors and the geographic market assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the economic outlook and the model considers key economic variables such as unemployment rate gross domestic product corporate bond spreads real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses the corporation also estimates ecl related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit financial guarantees unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the same models and methodologies as the funded exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments nonperforming loans and leases chargeoffs and delinquencies nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status loans accounted for under the fair value option and lhfs are not reported as nonperforming when a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible it is charged off against the allowance for credit losses if the chargedoff amount is later recovered the amount is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the recovery date chargeoffs are reported net of recoveries net chargeoffs if recoveries for the period are greater than chargeoffs net chargeoffs are reported as a negative amount in accordance with the corporations policies consumer real estatesecured loans including residential mortgages and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the fha or through individually insured longterm standby agreements with fannie mae fnma or freddie mac fhlmc the fullyinsured portfolio residential mortgage loans in the fullyinsured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and therefore are not reported as nonperforming juniorlien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying firstlien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due even if the juniorlien loan is current the outstanding balance of real estatesecured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured or for loans in bankruptcy within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming consumer loans secured by personal property credit card loans and other unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to chargeoff and therefore are not reported as nonperforming loans except for certain secured consumer loans including those that have been modified in a tdr personal propertysecured loans including auto loans are charged off to collateral value no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 120 days past due or upon repossession of an auto or for loans in bankruptcy within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing credit card and other unsecured customer loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud commercial loans and leases excluding business card loans that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection including loans that are individually identified as being impaired are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless wellsecured and in the process of collection business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible the entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customers billing statement interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status if applicable accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions otherwise such collections are credited to income when received loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected troubled debt restructurings consumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are classified as tdrs concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan payment extensions forgiveness of principal forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections loans that are carried at fair value and lhfs are not classified as tdrs bank of america 98 loans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a tdr and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms is expected otherwise the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming except for fullyinsured consumer real estate loans until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period generally six months if accruing tdrs cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms they are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming tdrs secured consumer loans that have been discharged in chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as tdrs at the time of discharge such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge if these loans are contractually current interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis consumer real estatesecured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as tdrs credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a tdr generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan 120 days past due a loan that had previously been modified in a tdr and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a tdr covid19 programs the corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic the pandemic in accordance with the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act the corporation has elected to not apply tdr classification to eligible covid19 related loan modifications that were performed after march 1 2020 to loans that were current as of december 31 2019 accordingly these restructurings are not classified as tdrs the availability of this election expired on january 1 2022 in addition for loans modified in response to the pandemic that do not meet the above criteria eg current payment status at december 31 2019 the corporation is applying the guidance included in an interagency statement issued by the bank regulatory agencies this guidance states that loan modifications performed in light of the pandemic including loan payment deferrals that are up to six months in duration that were granted to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a loan modification program or modifications granted under government mandated modification programs are not tdrs for loan modifications that include a payment deferral and are not tdrs the borrowers past due and nonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral period the corporation has continued to accrue interest during the deferral period using a constant effective yield method for most mortgage heloc and commercial loan modifications the contractual interest that accrued during the deferral period is payable at the maturity of the loan the corporation includes these amounts with the unpaid principal balance when computing its allowance for credit losses amounts that are subsequently deemed uncollectible are written off against the allowance for credit losses loans heldforsale loans that the corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable future including residential mortgages loan syndications and to a lesser degree commercial real estate consumer finance and other loans are reported as lhfs and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value the corporation accounts for certain lhfs including residential mortgage lhfs under the fair value option loan origination costs for lhfs carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and upon the sale of a loan are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income lhfs that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming as defined in the policy herein are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases premises and equipment premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings up to 12 years for furniture and equipment and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements other assets for the corporations financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans and leases on the consolidated balance sheet the corporation evaluates these assets for ecl using various techniques for assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell where the collateral consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets where the margining is expected to be maintained into the foreseeable future the expected losses are assumed to be zero for all other assets the corporation performs qualitative analyses including consideration of historical losses and current economic conditions to estimate any ecl which are then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a contraasset against the amortized cost basis of the financial asset lessee arrangements substantially all of the corporations lessee arrangements are operating leases under these arrangements the corporation records rightofuse assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement rightofuse assets are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and the related lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other liabilities all leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the corporation made the shortterm lease election lease expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense in the consolidated statement of income the corporation made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and nonlease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases as such lease payments represent payments on both lease and nonlease components at lease commencement lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the corporations incremental borrowing rate rightofuse assets initially equal the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments 99 bank of america made prior to lease commencement and for any lease incentives goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment at the reporting unit level a reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a business segment the corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value including goodwill as measured by allocated equity for purposes of goodwill impairment testing the corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit in performing its goodwill impairment testing the corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors include among other things macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity and reportingunit specific considerations if the corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative assessment is performed the corporation has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test the corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period when performing the quantitative assessment if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit would not be considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting units allocated equity exceeds its fair value an impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit an impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance for intangible assets subject to amortization an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value the carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value variable interest entities a vie is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments the corporation consolidates a vie if it has both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie on a quarterly basis the corporation reassesses its involvement with the vie and evaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its financial interests in the vie the consolidation status of the vies with which the corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments the corporation primarily uses vies for its securitization activities in which the corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle when the corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust including nonagency residential mortgages home equity loans credit cards and other loans the corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust the corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust the power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights the corporation consolidates a wholeloan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements other than standard representations and warranties that could potentially be significant to the trust the corporation may also transfer trading account securities and afs securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts the corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trusts liabilities or if there are no ongoing activities sole discretion over the design of the trust including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust the corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of thirdparty investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights other vies used by the corporation include collateralized debt obligations cdos investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles the corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for cdos and therefore does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a cdo however following an event of default if the corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a cdo and acquires the power to manage its assets the corporation consolidates the cdo the corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle derivative contracts or other arrangements the corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value in addition the corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated vies fair values of these debt securities which are classified as trading account assets debt securities carried at fair value or htm securities are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets generally quoted market prices for retained residual interests bank of america 100 are not available therefore the corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows fair value the corporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities where applicable in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price under this guidance an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value under applicable accounting standards fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs the corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this threelevel hierarchy level 1unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market as well as certain us treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in otc markets level 2observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchangetraded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data this category generally includes us government and agency mortgagebacked mbs and assetbacked securities abs corporate debt securities derivative contracts certain loans and lhfs level 3unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation the fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability this category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations consumer msrs certain abs highly structured complex or longdated derivative contracts certain loans and lhfs irlcs and certain cdos where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets income taxes there are two components of income tax expense current and deferred current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods these gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a twostep model first a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized and second the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement the difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit the corporation records income taxrelated interest and penalties if applicable within income tax expense revenue recognition the following summarizes the corporations revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities card income card income includes annual late and overlimit fees as well as interchange cash advances and other miscellaneous items from credit and debit card transactions and from processing card transactions for merchants card income is presented net of direct costs interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the

riskrelated losses occur within acceptable predefined limits creditrelated notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by cdo collateralized loan obligation clo 109 bank of america and creditlinked note vehicles these instruments are primarily classified as trading securities the carrying value of these instruments equals the corporations maximum exposure to loss the corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned creditrelated contingent features and collateral the corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the otc market with large international financial institutions including brokerdealers and to a lesser degree with a variety of nonfinancial companies a significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis therefore events such as a credit rating downgrade depending on the ultimate rating level or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty where applicable andor allow the corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades further as previously discussed on page 105 the corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events certain of the corporations derivative contracts contain credit riskrelated contingent features primarily in the form of isda master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the corporation has transacted these contingent features may be for the benefit of the corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the corporations creditworthiness and the marktomarket exposure under the derivative transactions at december 31 2021 and 2020 the corporation held cash and securities collateral of 914 billion and 965 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of 793 billion and 886 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements excluding crossproduct margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements in connection with certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements the corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the corporation or certain subsidiaries the amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount andor the market value of the exposure at december 31 2021 the amount of collateral calculated based on the terms of the contracts that the corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was 23 billion including 14 billion for bank of america national

summary of significant accounting principles 123 bank of america allowance for credit losses on january 1 2020 the corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on managements best estimate of lifetime ecl inherent in the corporations relevant financial assets upon adoption of the new accounting standard the corporation recorded a 33 billion or 32 percent increase in the allowance for credit losses on january 1 2020 which was comprised of a net increase of 29 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a 310 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the net increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by a 31 billion increase in credit card as the corporation now reserves for the life of these receivables the increase in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments included 119 million in the consumer portfolio for the undrawn portion of helocs and 191 million in the commercial portfolio for more information on the corporations credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses see note 1  summary of significant accounting principles the allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss experience the current credit quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of the loan qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but in the corporations assessment may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions the corporation incorporates forwardlooking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets these scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product unemployment rate real estate prices and corporate bond spreads the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators internal and thirdparty economist views and industry trends the december 31 2021 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic outlooks that included a baseline scenario which is derived from consensus estimates a downside scenario that assumed a significantly longer period until full economic recovery a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing a scenario to account for inflationary risk and higher interest rates and an upside scenario to consider the potential for improvement in the consensus outlooks the weighted economic outlook assumes that the us average unemployment rate will be just above five percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly declines to just under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023 additionally in this economic outlook us gross domestic product is forecasted to grow at 21 percent and 19 percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023 for comparison as of december 31 2020 the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the us average unemployment rate was forecasted at 66 percent 55 percent and 50 percent in the fourth quarters of 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for us gdp was forecasted to grow at 25 percent 24 percent and 21 percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarters of 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively the allowance for credit losses considered the impact of enacted government stimulus measures and continued to factor in the uncertainty resulting from the unprecedented nature of the current public health crisis and risks that may prevent a full economic recovery while there has been improvement across the us economy the corporation continues to factor into its allowance for credit losses an estimated impact from higherrisk segments that included leveraged loans and industries such as travel and entertainment which have been adversely impacted by the effects of the pandemic the allowance for credit losses at december 31 2021 was 138 billion a decrease of 68 billion compared to december 31 2020 the decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality the change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of 64 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a 422 million decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the decrease in the allowance for credit losses was attributed to 342 million in the consumer real estate portfolio 27 billion in the credit card and other consumer portfolio and 38 billion in the commercial portfolio similarly the provision for credit losses improved 159 billion to a benefit of 46 billion in 2021 compared to provision expense of 113 billion and 36 billion in 2020 and 2019 the benefit in 2021 was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option increased 501 billion in 2021 driven by commercial loans which increased 604 billion excluding small business primarily driven by global markets consumer loans increased 70 billion primarily

carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations primarily banks at december 31 2021 and 2020 the notional amount of these guarantees totaled 63 billion and 71 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 the corporations maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled 928 million and 11 billion with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039 indemnifications in the ordinary course of business the corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications such as tax indemnifications whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur such as a change in tax law the indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote these agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the corporation to exit the agreement upon these events the maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons including the occurrence of an external event the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses historically any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis the corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote merchant services prior to july 1 2020 a significant portion of the corporations merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in which the corporation held a 49 percent ownership interest effective july 1 2020 the corporation received its share of the joint ventures merchant contracts and began performing merchant processing services for these merchants 135 bank of america the corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants due to among other things merchant fraud or insolvency if charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers the corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges the ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the applicable regulatory and card network rules which include but are not limited to the type of charge type of payment used and time limits the total amount of transactions processed for the preceding sixmonth period which was 4762 billion is an estimate of the corporations maximum potential exposure as of december 31 2021 the corporations risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery the corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits guarantees letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants the corporations reserves for contingent losses and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant the corporation continues to monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic impacts of the pandemic exchange and clearing house member guarantees the corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses both in the us and other countries as a member the corporation may be required to pay a prorata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios the corporations potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses to the amount or multiple of the corporations contribution to the guarantee fund or in limited instances to the full prorata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund the corporations maximum potential exposure under these membership agreements is difficult to estimate however the corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote prime brokerage and securities clearing services in connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses the corporation performs securities clearance and settlement services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients under these arrangements the corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions the corporations obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the corporation on behalf of clients or their customers the corporations maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate however the potential for the corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote fixed income clearing corporation sponsored member repo program the corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the government securities division of the fixed income clearing corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the fixed income clearing corporations rules as part of this program the corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the fixed income clearing corporation the corporations guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or highquality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore the potential for the corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote the corporations maximum potential exposure without taking into consideration the related collateral was 420 billion and 225 billion at december 31 2021 and

amount due to the benefit of collateral and in some cases mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at december 31 2021 and 2020 was 84 billion and 85 billion these balances included 28 billion and 29 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 of claims related to loans in specific privatelabel securitization groups or tranches where the

previous negotiations and is subject to judgment a variety of assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures however the corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the corporations financial condition and liquidity see litigation and regulatory matters below for the corporations combined range of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation litigation and regulatory matters in the ordinary course of business the corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties the corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters or eventual loss fines or penalties related to each pending matter as a matter develops the corporation in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable and for the matters described below whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable the corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigationrelated expense the corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers litigationrelated expense of 164 million and 823 million was recognized in 2021 and 2020 for any matter disclosed in this note for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability and for representations and warranties exposures the corporations estimated range of possible loss is 0 to 10 billion in excess of the accrued liability if any as of december 31 2021 the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual the estimated range of possible loss does not represent the corporations maximum loss exposure information is provided below regarding the nature of the litigation and where specified associated claimed damages based on current knowledge and taking into account accrued liabilities management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters including the matters described below will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or liquidity of the corporation however in light of the significant judgment variety of assumptions and uncertainties involved in these matters some of which are beyond the corporations control and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the corporations business or results of operations for any particular reporting period or cause significant

paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the corporation measures fair value see note 1  summary of significant accounting principles the corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option for more information see note 21  fair value option valuation techniques the following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the corporations assets and liabilities while the corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date during 2021 there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had or are expected to have a material impact on the corporations consolidated financial position or results of operations trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions the fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk and interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate managements best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates loss severity and prepayment rates principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities underlying assets are valued using external pricing services where available or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the markets perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector in these instances fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors principally from reviewing the issuers financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies derivative assets and liabilities the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the otc market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position the majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources including brokers market transactions and thirdparty pricing services when thirdparty pricing services are used the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the corporation estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either optionbased or have longer maturity bank of america 150 dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable in which case quantitativebased extrapolations of rate price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity counterparty credit quality and other instrumentspecific factors where appropriate in addition the corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of otc derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position positions are netted by counterparty and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the corporations own credit risk the corporation also incorporates fva within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives an estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value primarily based on market data loans and loan commitments the fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices where available or discounted cash flow analyses using marketbased credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted as appropriate to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower mortgage servicing rights the fair values of msrs are primarily determined using an optionadjusted spread valuation approach which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of msrs this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using riskadjusted discount rates loans heldforsale the fair values of lhfs are based on quoted market prices where available or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the corporations current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk the borrowerspecific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables shortterm borrowings and longterm debt the corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities interest rates indices currencies or commodities the fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes these models incorporate observable and in some instances unobservable inputs including security prices interest rate yield curves option volatility currency commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs the corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities the credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market securities financing agreements the fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and

include rmbs commercial mbs whole loans and mortgage cdos commercial loans debt securities and other include corporate clos and cdos commercial loans and bonds and securities backed by nonreal estate assets structured liabilities primarily include equitylinked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option the corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its level 3 financial instruments for example market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together for a given product such as corporate debt securities market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model therefore the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques the levels of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories uncertainty of fair value measurements from unobservable inputs loans and securities a significant increase in market yields default rates loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for long positions short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way the impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and in the case of clos whether prepayments can be reinvested a significant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value for long positions and short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way structured liabilities and derivatives for credit derivatives a significant increase in market yield upfront points ie a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception credit spreads default rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers the impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument structured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument the sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche for senior tranches that are net purchases of protection a significant increase in default correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way for equity derivatives commodity derivatives interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities a significant change in longdated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs ie the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index between two different commodities between two different interest rates or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair value however the magnitude and direction of the impact depend on whether the corporation is long or short the exposure for structured liabilities a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value nonrecurring fair value the corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value only in certain situations eg the impairment of an asset

occidentals results to prices also will change marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil natural gas and to a lesser degree other commodities a 025 change in the midlandtogulfcoast oil spreads impacts budgeted 2022 operating cash flows by approximately 65 million occidentals results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices a variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of 10 per ton would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 10 million and 30 million respectively a variation in pvc prices of 001 per lb would have a pretax annual effect on income of approximately 30 million historically over time product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins occidental uses forwards derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations for oil and natural gas and swaps to manage interest rate risks risk management occidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies the controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check members of the risk management group report to the corporate vice president and treasurer controls for these activities include limits on value at risk limits on credit limits on total notional trade value segregation of duties delegation of authority daily price verifications reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls fair value of marketing derivative contracts occidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value fair values for these contracts are derived from level 1 and level 2 sources the fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant the following table shows the fair value of occidentals derivatives excluding collateral segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation maturity periods source of fair value

quantitative information occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities this measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95 level of confidence additionally occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice as a result of these controls occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance 56 oxy 2021 form 10k quantitative and qualitative disclosures interest rate risk general occidental pays fixed interest rates and receives a floating interest rate indexed to threemonth libor on its interest rate swaps the remaining swaps have mandatory termination dates in september 2022 and 2023 with notional amounts of 275 million and 450 million respectively as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 occidental had a net liability of approximately 428 million based on the fair value of the swaps of negative 751 million netted against 323 million in posted cash collateral a 25basis point decrease in implied libor rates over the term of the swaps would result in an additional liability of approximately 88 million on these swaps as of december 31 2021 occidental had variable rate debt with a notional value of 68 million outstanding a 25basis point increase in libor interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately 17 million per year as of december 31 2021 occidental had fixed rate debt with a fair value of 311 billion outstanding a 25basis point change in treasury rates would

bin january 2022 occidental used cash on hand to repay 101 million in outstanding 2600 senior notes due april 2022 at face value foreign currency risk occidentals international operations have limited currency risk occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes a vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in united states dollars additionally all of occidentals consolidated international oil and gas subsidiaries have the united states dollar as the functional currency the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income credit risk the majority of occidentals counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and any inability of these customers to meet their settlement commitments occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants as appropriate occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers which are subject to minimal credit risk if any certain otc derivative instruments contain creditriskcontingent features primarily tied to credit ratings for occidental or its counterparties which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post the fair value of derivative instruments with creditriskcontingent features that were net liabilities as of december 31 2021 was 107 million net of 323 million collateral and 104 million net of 374 million collateral as of december 31 2020 creditriskcontingent features are primarily related to interest rate swaps as of december 31 2021 the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties occidental believes its exposure to

See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\"</span>,\n",
       " <span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">AbbVie operates as a single global business segment dedicated to the research and development, manufacturing, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines and therapies. This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, \"Segment and Geographic Area Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"</span>,\n",

The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements—Other Licensing &amp; Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"</span>,\n",

Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie’s business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,130 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed. See Note 15, \"Legal Proceedings and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" AbbVie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.</span>,\n",
       " <span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing.\" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.</span>,\n",
       " <span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%\">AbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1, \"Business—Regulation—Discovery and Clinical Development,” “Business—Regulation—Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing,” and “Business—Regulation—Medical Devices.” The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs.</span>,\n",

The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.</span>,\n",

For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.
