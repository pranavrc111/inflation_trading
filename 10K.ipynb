As COVID-19 continues to have an impact worldwide, AbbVie is focused on the health and safety of its employees, health care professionals and patients and communities. In the continued operation of its business, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from relevant health authorities, managed manufacturing and supply chain resources and monitored closely its clinical trial sites.

This operating structure enables the Chief Executive Officer, as chief operating decision maker (CODM), to allocate resources and assess business performance on a global basis in order to achieve established long-term strategic goals. Consistent with this structure, a global research and development and supply chain organization is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Commercial efforts that coordinate the marketing, sales and distribution of these products are organized by geographic region or therapeutic area. All of these activities are supported by a global corporate administrative staff. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM for purposes of assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. See Note 16, \"Segment and Geographic Area Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" and the sales information related to AbbVie's key products and geographies included under Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"</span>,\n",

The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations.

Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie’s business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,130 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed.

Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs.</span>,\n",

The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets.
